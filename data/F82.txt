Madam President , even to a slightly unprejudiced eye , there is clearly no trace of racism down the broad middle of this House . 
Even if we disagree on a report on racism , the reasons lie not in racism in Parliament but in the report itself . 
For example , the report not only contains laudable words on the fight against racism ; it also deals with matters such as the voting rights of third country nationals in specific countries or the right to hold public office , which may be decided one way or the other , but which have nothing whatsoever to do with racism . 
And it is precisely on these points that this report is a dishonest and sorry effort and I make no bones about the fact . 
The fight against racism , to which we are all committed , is turned into small political currency and abused , which is why we are unable to vote for the report in its present form . 
I stand firmly against the way in which racism has been played down , as we have said , to make it a subject of political debate . 
That is our grave criticism of the approach taken in this report . 
We are all against racism and we all have a contribution to make . 
There should be a broad consensus on this in this House . 
But we cannot possibly allow this concept to be taken up by one side of the House and used to conduct a political fight ; we must insist that matters of this sort are dealt with in a way which can meet with everyone ' s approval , and that is not the case here .
