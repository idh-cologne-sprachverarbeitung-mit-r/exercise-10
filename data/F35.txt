Key sub - goals are : promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income ; secondly , safeguarding old - age pensions and making these affordable ; thirdly , promoting social integration and fourthly , guaranteeing affordable , first - rate health protection . 
Gender - related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals . 
I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification , for these four points are , in fact , to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought . 
The Commission ' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence . 
Macro - economic policy , employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together . 
The Commission has recognised this interrelatedness . 
It is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is , of course , underpinned by a sound macro - economic strategy and a sound employment strategy . 
These aspects are very much interconnected . 
It is , therefore , surprising that this topic has , to date , not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the Commission ' s notification constitutes a break - through in a way . 
It brings me great joy to witness that the Council now seems to accept this break - through and also wants to bring it to the fore in Lisbon . 
We should , of course , not get overly excited about it . 
It marks the beginning , rather than the end , of a process . 
Some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue . 
But it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion . 
The issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the European Union are quite different from one another . 
The challenges are different . The levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling gently but to make steady progress nonetheless . 
In this way , we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges . 
The majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen . 
The funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape ; from this perspective it is not a pie - in - the - sky report . 
It is a report which tries to give direction . 
There are , however , one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific . 
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this . 
But that does not take away from the fact that the report ' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon . 
I believe that if it were to be adopted in Lisbon in this way , Lisbon will turn out to be a success . 
If it is not adopted , Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past . 
As far as this is concerned , the report , albeit a component , may well be the key component of Lisbon , because it is really innovative , while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before . 
All in all , I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report . 
I hope that Europe , in terms of social protection , will make a step forward , taking into account subsidiarity , for without subsidiarity , this would not be possible . 
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , like my fellow MEP , Bartho Pronk , please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and , in particular , to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report . 
Commissioner , the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance . 
There have been times within this Parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward . 
It is also a timely discussion - as Mr Pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the Lisbon Summit , which intends to find out how we can put economic growth , employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society . 
Within my group , it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon . 
My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go - ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that , in fact , a group of high - ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000 . 
However , we , the Parliament and , in particular , the group of the Social Democrats , want Lisbon to go one step further now . 
It is of great importance that , in our fellow MEP ' s report , this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence , based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so - called Luxembourg strategy , that is to say it should encompass common goals , guidelines , national action plans and performance evaluations . 
We believe that this course of action is ambitious , yet achievable . 
Needless to say , it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level . 
The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this , and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda , and why , in fact , scenarios such as Danny Peters ' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground . 
But this new course of action is very exciting . 
The employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary , for our social security systems are facing the same challenges , and in an EMU era , social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition . 
But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group : social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation . They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation . 
I think that it also a good thing if , moreover , the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001 . 
I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group ' s idea and we hope , Commissioner , that we can also count on your support . 
Finally , we urge the European Parliament , both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process . 
The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support . 
Mr President , the four chief objectives which the EU countries ' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows : that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income ; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable ; that social integration should be promoted ; and that sustainable , high - quality health care should be guaranteed . 
These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them . 
Having a group of high - ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from . 
The Commission ' s communication , which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November , is a well - balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union . 
We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets , which is a problem for many Member States . 
If reforms are not got under way , we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy , and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security . 
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda . 
In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU , we often use the expression social convergence . 
As liberals , we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies . 
It is not , therefore , about harmonisation but about common objectives . 
It is , of course , a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy . 
We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and , in spite of there being many points of similarity , there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned . 
It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern . 
National policy is , of course , subject to a number of common parameters . That is the case with minimum social entitlements , which are established by treaty . 
It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements . It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies ; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation . 
So coordination and cooperation are facts of life . But convergence should be about goals , not means . 
I should also like to thank the rapporteur , Jan Andersson , for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report . 
I can support the report , but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste . 
I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems , if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient , or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries . 
I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission ' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly , and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold . 
Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended , but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same . There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions . 
Mr President , Commissioner , with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security , I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me . 
I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier . 
This seems to be a good thing and useful . 
I also feel positive about the essence of the communication , namely the strategic approach . 
We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved . 
We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled . 
On the one hand , it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg , but we also think it is important , as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker , that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios , such as sole traders , etc . 
We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found . 
The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security , which , we hope , will be replaced by high - level convergence . 
I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union . 
It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments , in fact , the majority of them , appear to be downward adjustments , the remainder being improvements . 
The lion ' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans : eleven restrictions and two improvements . 
In the case of unemployment benefits , we came across six restrictions and five improvements . 
The reasons for adjustments are , for example , to improve employment , reduce social security expenditure , but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria . 
Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries . 
The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries . 
All in all , both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole . 
This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches . 
To use a figure of speech , cappuccino is not always good for us .
