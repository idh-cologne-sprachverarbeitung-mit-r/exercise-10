Madam President , I would be most grateful if we could lay Mrs Caroline Jackson ' s resolution to rest in the Committee on the Environment ; we could take care of it in three or four minutes . 
I would be most grateful if we do that right now . 
I feel that we should not spend any more time on this . 
I will therefore put this to the House . 
Madam President , please note that the French socialists in the House will not take part in the vote as we consider that the tabled motion is not impartial . 
We do want the environmental directives to be applied and integrated into European policies but this must involve all the directives and not just the Natura 2000 and migratory birds directives . 
We also consider that the application of directives is the responsibility of the law , the Commission and the Court of Justice . 
We do not therefore wish to take part in this vote which we regard as partisan . 
We do not in fact yet know whether we will be voting on this motion this morning as I was going to put this to the House .
