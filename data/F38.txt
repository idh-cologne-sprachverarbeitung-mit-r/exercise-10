Mr President , it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency , particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future , given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level . The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today , is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy . 
I shall , of course , give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making . 
I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel , at EU level , to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years , which has benefited people in all walks of life , throughout the world , in terms of well - being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that , at the same time , there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world . 
This endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace . We are all therefore duty - bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet . 
The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets . 
A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged , which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments , which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies . 
We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas : 
Firstly , there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players , by which I mean donors , requiring greater coordination , greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies ; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems . 
At the same time , however , there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate , particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems , together with a need to focus special attention on these countries ' own policies for reducing poverty . 
The second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development . This means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy , but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance , trade and investment . 
Furthermore , this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries ' own policies . 
A third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives . 
Since 1995 , following a concerted international effort between the main donor states , involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD ' s Development Assistance Committee , it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies , both at national and international level . 
As you will know , the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50 % by 2015 , by increasing compulsory schooling , by significantly reducing child mortality rates , and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective . 
This would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world ' s population lives , and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people . This is an extraordinary state of affairs , which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively . 
And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise . Particularly in recent years , development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter , and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership . 
The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here , as has the Bretton Woods system . 
I have in mind , in particular , the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank , especially through its Comprehensive Framework document , and by the International Monetary Fund , where , for the first time , an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link , for a body of this type , between debt relief and poverty . 
This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context . 
The Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies , and to create greater scope for coordination , in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system . 
If we are to strengthen the European Union ' s role in international development policies , we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action . 
Firstly , we need to make the EU ' s development policy more effective . 
As you know , an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies , and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency . 
The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues . 
The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies , the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union ' s present cooperation policies , the need to make the EU ' s aid management more efficient and , in particular , to review its mechanisms for intervention , and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid . 
A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more . 
It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States ' national policies , which are not always complementary or well coordinated . 
A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions . 
In this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost , as soon as possible , to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary . 
The third aspect I would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of EU policies , the central theme of today ' s debate . 
Firstly , we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other European Union policies , so that development objectives can be achieved , not merely through aid and support , but also , first and foremost , through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development . 
As you know , a Council Resolution was approved , in June 1997 , under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports . 
The first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999 , and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination , notably in the fields of peace building , food safety , fisheries and migration . 
But as you will also be aware , we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence , together with the communication on development policy . 
Over the coming months , that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency , this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us . 
It is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the European Union . Only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies . 
But , quite apart from this , we would like to emphasise that , if we are to strengthen the coherence of European Union policies in the present circumstances and in the economic situation currently facing the Union , we need to give serious consideration to various issues associated with the dynamics of the European Union itself . 
By this I mean , of course , the internal dynamics of the European Union . 
We know that the European Union has its own dynamics , which stem above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam , which has reinforced its political dimension . This inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development . 
We will also have to await the outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference as regards enlargement , to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies , and , as regards development in particular , to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective . 
The second aspect that we need to consider , in relation to the coherence of policies , is development policy in the context of the Union ' s foreign policy . 
We know that the Union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy , and we know that , with the creation of the High Representative , of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity , there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies . 
We also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue , with the adoption of common positions or joint actions , with the preparation of joint strategies , with preventive diplomacy , and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management . 
There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union ' s foreign policy . 
It has to be said that , in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy , the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies . The success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision - making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy , so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy . 
In this context , we are convinced that we need to move away from the post ­ colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid . I say this because we know that , in Europe , development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States , in view of the post - colonial concerns of those states . 
The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States ' policy . 
Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States ' policies with the European Union ' s development policy . 
If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies , it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy . 
Ladies and gentlemen , the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention , regarding development policy , is , of course , the Development Council . There have been discussions , especially in recent months , about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies . 
As you know , there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF ' s financing , or rather lack of financing . 
It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union ' s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions , which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils , in other decision - making forums , ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council . Up to now , the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions . 
So without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which , although it directly impacts on the European Union ' s development policy , is largely being dealt with outside this decision - making forum , it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives . 
The views of the European Parliament on this issue too , will certainly be both timely and welcome . 
 . Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries . 
I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations . 
I saw Member States working as a team , which was indeed a wonderful experience . 
There was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over , not just because it was over , but because we all knew that we had achieved something together , the EU and the 71 ACP countries . 
That is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation . 
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement . 
We explicitly address corruption ; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever . 
We promote participatory approaches , we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the EU . 
We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies . 
We base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country ' s needs , but also of its policy performance . 
We create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector . 
We rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming , allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme . 
We decentralise administrative and , in some cases , financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective . 
We improve the policy framework for trade and investment development . 
We enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade , including new issues such as labour standards and the linkages between environment and trade . 
After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements . 
Let me turn to some of the more important points . 
Firstly the agreement on political issues . 
The new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership , a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support . 
Secondly , a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights , democratic principles and the rule of law . 
In comparison with the current procedure , the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process , with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation . 
In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements , measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified . 
Thirdly , the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption . 
This is a real innovation , both in the EU / ACP context and in international relations in general . 
This procedure will be applied , not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money , but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development . 
It is thus not confined to EC activities . 
This is a very important aspect , taking into account the fundability of public finances . 
By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement , the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors . 
Another new theme in the ACP - EU agreement is migration . 
We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area . 
This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999 . 
The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions . 
The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives , in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU , and measures facilitating their integration . 
We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration . 
The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining , within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country , the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party . 
This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons . 
These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance . 
The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid . 
We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade - related matters . 
We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time - frame of the trade negotiations is concerned . 
Negotiations will start no later than 2002 . 
This two - year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries ' capacity to conduct trade negotiations . 
A six - year period is programmed for these negotiations . 
We will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways : firstly , through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and , secondly , by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity - building and cooperation in multilateral forums . 
This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime . 
Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners . 
Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know - how and technology will be transferred , all of which will boost the ACP countries ' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy . 
In addition , the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor . 
They will lock in the economic reforms , just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties ' commitments under the agreements . 
The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction . 
Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU ' s trade regime for all least - developed countries , 39 of which are actually in the ACP group . 
This process will take place in the coming five years so that , by 2005 , the LDCs ' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market . 
As regards the volume of the next EDF , the EU has made its financial proposal . 
It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective . 
Today about EUR 9 . 5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted . 
The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances , plus the new EDF resources , over a seven - year period , that is to say , before the entry into force of the next financial protocol . 
This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period . 
We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity , we are moving into a period of increased activity . 
Such a commitment entails an in - depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides . 
There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such , and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries . 
Turning to our development policy , I would say that the global context has changed drastically . 
The marginalisation of many economies , increased poverty in the world , the need for better management of environmental interdependence , the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns . 
It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves . 
Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned . 
To focus on the input coming from the evaluations , I would mention the following problems : the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence . 
This is due to the complexity of our own structures , but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States . 
The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments , procedures and institutional mechanisms . 
Often policies are more determined by the instruments available , than by policy objectives and clearly - defined priorities . 
Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage . 
On average , to manage $ US 10 million of aid there are 2 . 9 staff at the Commission , compared with 4 . 3 at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States . 
This is a real problem : there are too many different financial instruments , each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings . 
This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system . 
In order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament . 
It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way , which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework , that is , the Council and Parliament . 
The lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States themselves and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed . 
By focusing the Community ' s development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States . 
This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado . 
When we talk policies nowadays , we engage in a process of convergence . 
This is part of the solution . 
We are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action . 
Everything has become more and more complex . 
This is also true of development cooperation . 
No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes , ranging from macro - economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross - cutting themes such as gender , environment , good governance and institutional reforms . 
It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country . 
This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action . 
This is where we want to go . 
To identify the EC ' s priority areas of support , account has to be taken of the Community ' s specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions . 
I will mention just a few : our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation ; our neutrality and defence of overall Community interests ; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual Member States can normally do . 
Also , our presence on the ground : basically , I find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves , we are seen as a neutral , welcome partner for this experiment world - wide - something which nobody else can claim to be . 
It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework . 
It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up , by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement . 
We will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested . 
I see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate . 
Parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect . 
This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing . 
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson . 
I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF . 
The problem , however , should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission ; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget . 
This sermon , therefore , really belongs in the Council . 
Mr President , I thank Mr Nielson . 
He has talked extensively about the new Lomé Convention , although this is not really the topic of this morning ' s meeting . 
We want to talk about coherence . 
This is the topic . 
Ever since the early nineties , the European Parliament , the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired , especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies . 
This problem has been highlighted on several occasions , to whit in 1992 , in 1995 and 1997 . 
The examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us . 
I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now . 
In fact , the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997 . 
In 1998 , it was agreed that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements . 
But what have we seen since then ? 
Fine words , as is the case again today , but no report . 
It is too crazy for words , really . 
It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy . 
Time and time again , good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented . 
It is , therefore , with good reason that we bring this up here today . 
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions . 
A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production . 
In the Union , sugar is produced from sugar beet . 
In order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar , a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar . 
The result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the Union is significantly restricted . 
At the same time , we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid . 
A Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me : If you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union , we would not need your development aid at all . 
Another example is cacao . 
The European Union intends to permit 5 % of alternative fats in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market . 
This could just as well be 0 %  - the internal market would still be harmonised . 
By pitching the percentage level at 5 % , which is now likely to be the case , it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage . 
It seems to be heading this way nevertheless . 
What are we actually doing then ? 
This is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does ? 
It seems that European industry is more important here than our own principles , our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries . 
There are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes . 
Why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma , where an elected President is imprisoned , parliament has been sent home and some of the MPs have been put in jail or even murdered ? 
Why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan , where a great deal of the fighting is still going on , with weapons , no less , funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are ? 
The inconsistency is astonishing . 
Here too , Mr Nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new Lomé Convention . 
If the new Lomé Convention is simply put into operation , without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy , the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a biblical expression . 
The Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time : in agriculture , commerce , in conflict prevention , in the peace operations , in the fisheries sector , migration and environment . 
Mr Nielson , what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy . 
Once again , all your fine examples , your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground . 
This is also at the request of the citizens . 
We have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992 : this is the topic of this debate . 
I hope the message strikes home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures . 
Mr President , Mr President - in - Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , following the same line as Mrs Maij - Weggen , I believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate . 
The topic touches the very core of the European Union . 
Let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating . 
Article 178 , Title XX of the consolidated Treaties of the European Union reads as follows :  " The Community shall take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries "  . 
What are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account ? 
Article 177 specifies these objectives as " sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries , and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them "  , the " smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries "  . 
Mr President , these are no arbitrary objectives . These are articles , statutory articles , which form part of the European acquis established by law with which the European institutions and Member States must comply . 
Every statutory article should , of course , not just be judged on its regularity , but also on the importance of its contents . 
I am of the opinion - and luckily I am not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens . 
The interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government . 
This is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society , and also important from the point of view of effectiveness , for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently . 
We should not make reality out to be more rose - tinted than it really is . 
Reality is obstinate . 
It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner , without any backhandedness . 
The government is obliged to show up any of its dilemmas , and to show where , when and why , problems occur with coherence of policy , rather than sweeping it all under the carpet . 
What we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure . Poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention . 
It is only natural that we in Parliament guard the interests of our citizens , but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable , international environment , in which the goal of human safety is pursued . 
This is a moral interest , a safety interest and is , ultimately , even in the interest of our economy . 
In whose interest is it really if European taxpayers ' money is used to support economic development in Namibia , and if , at the same time , the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically undercut by rigorous export subsidies , financed by the same tax payers ? 
We are all acting as if this is not really happening , but we all know that it is . 
It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand . 
The general interest of policy coherence is , therefore , a responsibility of the Commission as a whole , of the Council , and of the European Parliament . 
This responsibility cannot only be borne by the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid , however much we like to see him or hear him talk , or by the Development Council or the parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation . 
What we need here is an integral approach . 
After the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson , I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals , not only by Mr Nielson , but by the entire Commission , in order to make the policy coherent as a whole . 
This is why we urge the Commission , in this sharp and clear resolution , to develop specific instruments . 
We need to pinpoint , and draw up an inventory of , the problem areas for coherence . 
We need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved . 
This is why I advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent . 
This is why we need to set up inter - service task groups in the Commission , in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , if our neighbour ' s roof is leaking , we can lend him pots and pans to collect the water , but it is , of course , more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof . 
The crisis in last year ' s Commission has been solved today , but the Commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach , which , no doubt , the entire Parliament will soon demand in the resolution . 
I would wish the Commissioner all the best in his battle within the Commission and wish Mr Amado the same within the Council . 
Mr President , let us be clear from the outset : when it comes to cooperation , coherence is far from being the watchword . 
The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but , as the previous speakers have explained so well , there are various distortions to these declarations . 
The first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policies . 
This gives rise to serious malfunctions , because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes , whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done . 
And let us not forget that the de facto neo - colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop . 
The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes . 
We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State . 
The third area of incoherence is human rights . 
We say that we want to protect human rights . 
We encourage developing countries to respect human rights . 
We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights . 
We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns . 
And yet , at the same time , we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti - personnel mines . 
Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations . 
The fourth area of incoherence in the European Union ' s cooperation policy is this : how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping . 
The European Union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries . 
We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them . 
I will not even mention oil ; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa . 
Furthermore , and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence , we demand respect for biodiversity , for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature ; but at the same time , and this was apparent during recent negotiations , we force ACP countries to sign TRIPS agreements . 
These agreements risk being extended to living organisms , which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small - scale farmers in the south , at the hands of the multinationals . 
And yet , and this is the sixth area of incoherence , we do not defend the application of the current Treaties . 
On the one hand , we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and , on the other hand , we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS , despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre . 
Similarly , during the WTO negotiations , at a time when , to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report ,  " the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries , especially the poor "  , the European Union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring ACP countries , albeit with a transitional period of several years , instead of strengthening it , especially for the poorest countries . 
The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature . 
We are always saying think globally , act locally . 
And yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs . 
And what about agriculture and the environment ? Still more problems , still more areas of incoherence which I might have highlighted , not to mention research , emigration or health . 
In short , we claim that we want to help developing countries and , at the same time , we encourage the liberalisation of trade , which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective . 
I say it again , the European Union ' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent . and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament , the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort , at long last , to put some coherence into our policy . 
Mr President , I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate , not just because development is in general an important issue , but because it is also a topical one . 
Seattle was a failure , and north - south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons . 
The meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries . 
The Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok , and is suffering the consequences of that failure . 
In the meantime , however , as has already been mentioned , the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded . 
This goes to show just how topical this subject is . 
We could also add to the list the next EU - OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April . 
However , I would also like to add that any analysis , no matter how superficial , inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north - south relations , including those between the European Union and the less developed countries . 
You only have to realise that the category of " least developed countries " has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years , and now represents 13 % of the world ' s population , yet this category only accounts for 0 . 4 % of world exports and 0 . 6 % of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23 % since 1990 . 
Furthermore , the recent Community budget cuts in this area , for the present financial year , are part of this trend , as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message . 
Michel Camdessus , a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund , said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference , and I am now quoting , that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other . 
He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries . 
It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position , but he did indeed say this , and I heard it with my own ears . 
This comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation , and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north - south relations and break the mould . In particular , we need to reconsider the role of the European Union in this area , as I am certain that one of the Union ' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order . 
It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation , bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based , and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries , particularly in this context . 
A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries . 
This is a positive development in itself , especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue . 
We will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth , but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time , even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points . 
Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these . 
This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions , and this is certainly true of the European Union , especially in the field of good governance and trade . 
But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group , which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle . 
I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging , especially as regards trade , and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area . 
Lastly , we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries . 
I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects , indebtedness , assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety , humanitarian , educational and health - related issues , and also fields such as the environment , investment and access to information and new technologies . This also applies to the sphere of trade , where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies , and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States . 
We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong - headed . 
Mr President , having listened to the Council and the Commission today , I just had to look at my agenda . 
Yes , it does say :  ' Coherence of different Union policies with development policy '  . 
But we have not heard a single word on this subject , and I find that deeply embarrassing . 
We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years . 
It ought to have been here in writing today and , after having heard Mr Nielson ' s speech , I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission . 
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence , and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today . 
Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence , I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism , namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new , relevant legislation from this aspect . 
I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU ' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries : dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa , tomato purée in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica . 
The examples are , I hope , all well known . 
In any case , they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU - subsidised products . 
European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU . 
This is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries , which accounts for 69 % of the total work force there compared with 1 . 7 % in the EU . 
Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34 % of the developing countries ' gross national product , compared with 5 . 3 % in the EU . 
There is neither coherence nor human decency here . 
Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact ? 
Mr President , how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental . 
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council . 
They pointed out that the UK , France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population . 
They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto . 
Is the Council discussing this issue ? 
Is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members , rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent ? 
Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what , if any , consideration has been given to it ? 
As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union , surely it should receive priority consideration . 
How decisions are made is all - important . 
co - president of the ACP - EU Joint Assembly . Mr President , I thank the Council and the Commission for their statements this morning , but I will concentrate on coherence policy because that is what the agenda says we are talking about . 
Much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policies and development policy , I question whether today is the time to be holding it . 
However , the Council statement gave me hope for the future . 
It is quite obvious to me , as someone who specialises in development policy , that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations . 
I will give some examples shortly . 
However , I remind this House that , back in June 1997 , a Council resolution acknowledged the fact that there is a serious lack of coherence in some of the EU policies in relation to its development cooperation policy . 
This was followed by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report , the first of which was to be discussed in 1998 . 
We still await the first report , and that is why I believe this debate was premature , as the Commission had little to say on coherence this morning . 
The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important , such as peace - building , conflict prevention and resolution , food security , fisheries and immigration . 
Some of these issues have been discussed in depth . 
I personally feel that issues such as peace - building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State , with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter . 
The issues that are really affected by lack of coherence are in areas such agriculture , trade , environment and biodiversity , but herein lies the real problem : these are the highly sensitive areas of policy within the European Union as a whole and in this Parliament in particular . 
Members of this House will have differing views , even within the same political parties , depending on ( a ) which country they come from or ( b ) which committee they sit on . 
There are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries . 
As a lack of coherence , one can cite as Mrs Sandbæk did , the exporting of milk products to Jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the Jamaican dairy industry . 
We have beef exported to southern Africa , to Namibia and South Africa , which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland , so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union . 
Remember too , some countries blocked an agreement with South African trade for four years . 
If we simply import raw materials from these developing countries , rather than allowing them the add - on value of producing their finished articles in their own country , we deny them the very poverty - eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations . 
I am not surprised the Commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development . 
There is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment . 
I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document . 
Mr President , this morning ' s debate is very important . 
I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for having made a statement on the coherence of Community policies in relation to development , because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective . 
However , if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy , we will end up totally frustrated and , furthermore , the result will be negative . 
As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics , it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out . 
The result of this absurd game is not zero , but rather a minus number , as a consequence of the material , financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise . 
With regard to policy , this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another . 
In today ' s globalised world , this fact is all the more obvious . 
There are no boundaries for Community policies . 
I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies , and that , together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission , they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union . 
Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state , in their respective working programmes , that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries , but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence . 
Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied . 
For example , the Commission , in its long term guidelines , says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity , supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account . 
The Commission is addressing a very important area , that is , commercial policy . 
However , this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development , agriculture , fisheries policy , immigration , our position in international financial institutions , the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform . 
The Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time , it is true , being in November 1999 , and also on other occasions , such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results . 
Since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say , as some previous speakers have pointed out . 
However , as Parliament , we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter - service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different Community policies , which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves . 
What we really want , however , is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination , complementarity and , the most complex one , which we are discussing at the moment , coherence , will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union . 
Let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference , the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development services - , this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement , to perfect a more coherent political union . 
We therefore hope that the Commission , in the report it is going to present to us on global policy , will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of Community resources and the specific management of public interests . 
Mr President , I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their reports and , in common with others , express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence . 
But we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is . 
I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of , in my view , useful figures . 
At the beginning of the nineteenth century , real per capita income in the world ' s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries . In 1900 it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher . 
And there is no sign of this trend ' s being reversed . 
On the contrary , it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further . 
This is shown by the following figures : the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30 : 1 in 1960 , 60 : 1 in 1990 and 74 : 1 in 1997 . These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off . 
In other words , there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries , including the EU countries , are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale . 
In a global village , major discrepancies in the world will not , in the longer term , be tolerated by the poorest section of the village . 
At some time or another , there will be a revolt , and it will be fully justified . 
I would therefore urge the Council ' s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and , above all , to conclude it in such a way that we all of us , including the people of Europe , realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide . 
The EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0 . 7 % . 
It may well be that others are worse , but that does not place us in any better a light . 
Above all , however , we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us . 
As far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President - in - Office of the Council did not mention the word " trade " at all . 
I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States . I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up , not only in the Commission but also in the Member States . 
I should also like to say that , in my view , what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from , respectively , the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development . In that way , we should perhaps have a basis for discussion , instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission , which is scarcely likely to produce results . 
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution . 
As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels , we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications . 
Let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries . 
This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and , in this connection , the EU can set the agenda , leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities . 
Mr President ,  " The EU ' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired "  . 
This is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week , commenting on the Union ' s development policy . 
This is not new . 
Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation , its effectiveness and quality have been called into question . 
Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror . 
Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally ? 
One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy ' s internal conflict . 
In terms of trade and agriculture , in particular , the European policy is in conflict with the development policy . 
We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries . 
This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation . 
We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations , but as a policy in its own right . 
I advocate transparent , joint and efficient development policy . 
As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money , it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States . 
Finally , I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible , so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way . 
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense . 
As various Members have already commented , we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies , whose objectives run counter to development in those countries . 
And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies , tourism , the environment , agriculture , fisheries and industry . 
We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies . 
So there is a whole raft of contradictions . 
In my opinion , these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies . 
They are , if anything , more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States . 
We have to be aware of this . 
We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world , as was recently the case with Indonesia , when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment . 
For me , these are the most serious contradictions in all this , more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies . 
We obviously know that , even within any one country , there are always contradictions between various policies . 
That is a fact of life . 
And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies , in this case development policy . 
We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them . 
The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one . 
I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy , and that this monitoring centre ' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies , but should also cover Member States ' actions and policies , including the actions of economic groups , which I think are also important . 
This monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction . 
I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House . 
Our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective , not merely within the European Union , but also at world level , given the increasing globalisation of the economy . 
If we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next WTO round of multilateral negotiations , because it would be contradictory if the European Union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself , only for the United States and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint . 
That is why I consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principles to be established at the next WTO round . 
Mr President , the Director - General of the DG for Development has said that to produce a report on coherence of EU policies with development policies , before this spring ' s paper on development policy itself , is like putting the cart before the horse . 
Never mind that the Commission ' s requirement to produce an annual report , set out clearly in the Council resolution , has produced only one " non - paper "  , the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is climbing uphill and the cart of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards . 
Time after time development policy is forgotten or is an afterthought when the major policies of this European Union are considered . 
Take the new chocolate directive , which shows that EU countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid . 
There has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries , 90 % of which are our ACP partners , estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15 % . 
Take the fishing agreements , where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the EU waters . 
We are , at the same time , negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe ' s large - scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small - scale fish workers in those countries world - wide . 
Take the trade agreements . 
As Mr Nielson said this morning with regard to Lomé , preferential access is only for " essentially all the products of the least - developed countries "  . 
In other words , when EU commercial interests are concerned , poverty considerations go out of the window . 
In the stance that we took at Seattle , why such a silence on the EU ' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the GATT , including for the crucial textile sector ? 
On the common agricultural policy , the biggest culprit - no development impact assessment of the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms . 
Everyone now knows of the scandal of the export refund scheme which dumped 54 000 tonnes of excess subsidised beef on West African markets , slashing prices for local cattle farmers by half . 
Today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes . 
Who will be next , quite literally , for the chop ? 
I welcome Mr Amadeus ' statement this morning , which acknowledged the difficulties of non - budgetisation of the EDF , which called for a more active role for the Development Council and which called for development priorities to be central to the EU ' s emerging common foreign and security policy . 
I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992 , its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union . 
Action simply has not been taken . 
That is why we want annual reports , we want an annual inter - service group and we want a complaints procedure , to make sure action is actually taken . 
I ask Mr Nielson , in his summing - up , to directly address those points in the resolution . 
Mr President , I would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture . 
Over the past couple of years , a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and , more especially , the Lomé countries . 
The results are certainly not what we expected . 
What could be the cause of this ? 
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries , barring a few exceptions . 
I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop . 
No farmer , anywhere in the world , will produce something if prices are too low . 
The governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma : whom should they support , the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food ? 
This fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission , and not by the Commission on its own . In most countries where the Commission is active , development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves . 
It should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravenes that of the Commission . 
It is up to the Commission ' s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach . 
Special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production . 
Far too often , artificial fertiliser , veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge . 
Once the project comes to an end after five years , the policy of free gifts also ends . 
I think , therefore , that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects , and as far as I know , this is not the case by any stretch of the imagination . 
Finally , I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use . 
Every year , I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund , that they are far behind in spending the funds . 
Mr President , Mr President - in - Office of the Council , Commissioner , we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted , which is a pity . 
We should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi , for example , who has missed a great chance right from the outset , for he has allowed the development cooperation policy to fragment over three Commissioners - and this is better than four , I have to admit - but this does not really make for a coherent policy . 
We also note that , as before , there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments . 
The President - in - Office of the Council came up with a good suggestion , namely to budget the European Development Fund . 
Parliament would , of course , welcome this with open arms . 
If this were possible , it would be a huge , historic victory . 
Since Amsterdam , three terms have taken centre stage : complementarity , coordination and cohesion . 
I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields . 
If a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion , if a request is made at all , then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult , unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all . 
I would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion , and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion , for it is a long way off yet . 
One thing shocked me in the speech of the President - in - Office of the Council . 
He stated :  " Contradictions in policy can lead to balance . " 
It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand , and vice versa . 
But this leads to status - quo and self - deceit , and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes , indeed , but changes which have only made poverty worse . 
This is supposed to be our priority , would you believe . 
I know that we do a great deal of good , but let us start with this very essential aspect . 
Mr President , we have already noted that there is no report from the Commission , but I intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the Council presented in its 1997 opinion . 
The first is concerned with conflict resolution . 
For many years , I have tried , through the Council and the Commission , to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in , and working for , conflict resolution in the Western Sahara , which is occupied by Morocco . 
The UN has a peace plan . We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end . 
I also want to take up the subject of migration . 
I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries , which might make it easier to expel immigrants , asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds . 
I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms . 
We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds . 
Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age . 
This is not because of a lack of food , but because of what we have talked a lot about today , namely increasing poverty . 
Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests . 
I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply , specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason . 
I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce . 
Women appear to be completely absent from all areas , especially development policy when , of course , we are not in reality absent at all . 
Mr President , the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid . 
The level of aid is naturally important , and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased . This ought to be done with , in particular , a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity . 
However , the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries . 
A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed . 
The latter include trade , agricultural and fisheries policies . 
Other important areas are , of course , the flow of private investments , cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with , and finances solutions to , a variety of global problems which affect us all . 
These problems include questions of climate , health issues , biodiversity etc , and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation , that is to say the new economy which is developing . 
In this economy , the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked . 
In my opinion , what we are discussing here today is partly the EU ' s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance . 
The report , or survey , which Mrs Maij - Weggen has demanded , showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be , is naturally quite crucial . 
I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more . 
The Commission is new and has to be given time , but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the Commission . 
I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission . 
In addition to a report of this kind , I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character . 
An analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries . 
These include technology , trade , cooperation in the field of research etc . It should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting . 
Finally , Parliament recommends , in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution , that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence . 
I believe it is only a coincidence , but the Commissioner for the Environment is also , of course , to participate in this group . 
Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed . 
Policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other . 
There are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest . 
Mr President , the Seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less - and least - developed countries , it is purely a rich country selfish interest . 
Yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent . 
There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs , allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain . 
It did not work ; poverty became worse than ever . 
The medicine may not taste too good in the short term , but opening one ' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term . 
Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular ? 
As Mr Nielson said , this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity . 
Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough . 
We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries . 
Parliament ' s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU . 
Eliminating all remaining barriers to imports , tariff barriers and quotas and , just as important , non - tariff barriers , such as Mrs Maij - Weggen mentioned in her speech - eliminating these barriers would do more than any amount of development aid to secure for developing countries the economic progress which both we and they desire . 
It is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words . 
Mr President , in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence , coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States . 
There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union ' s ability to match words with action . 
I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti - personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes , to post - conflict reconstruction , and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world , particularly in developing countries . 
Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance , assistance to victims and related activities . 
The Member States have spent similar amounts . 
But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti - personnel landmine problem within a finite time span . 
Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States . 
This has been talked about for years . 
The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes , strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions , ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell . 
It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes . 
A proper stock - taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines . 
It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational , procedural , financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union . 
Are these afflictions of the past , or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations ? 
Mr President , Commissioner Nielson , the conclusion of the new ACP - EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence . 
And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights , democracy , rule of law , and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously , and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent , rather , we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect . 
For these are prerequisite to any development . 
If these criteria are not adhered to , then development does not stand a chance
The same goes for Cuba , Mr Modrow . 
I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process . 
But for this to happen , there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba . 
After all , we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International . 
It may well be that you , having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships , view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber , and that you have problems where good governance is concerned . 
Nonetheless , these are important criteria for the European Union . 
There is a second issue I would like to raise . 
We are discussing coherence here . 
Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent . 
In my view , however , the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too . 
There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another . 
Nor is there coherence vis - à - vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union ' s budget but the EDF remains outside it . 
Mr President - in - Office of the Council , if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13 . 5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control , and to bodies such as OLAF , then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability . 
This , to my mind , is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do , i . e . establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union . 
Mr President , we certainly must concede that , on balance , this text is full of good intentions , but we did not vote in favour of it in committee , nor shall we do so in plenary . We had two reasons for this , both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly . 
First , the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF ; clearly that is misguided . 
In our view , cooperation is , and should remain , an intergovernmental exercise . 
With Europe preparing to enlarge , communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget , quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy . 
Lastly , the Commission has , in the recent past , had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently , as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely . 
Why should we add to them ? 
Secondly , we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie ' s report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because , in the final analysis , this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse . 
It is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank . 
And let me say in passing , it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to . 
As a result , we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed . 
The part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the Union ends up paying producers to stop producing sherry , port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law . 
Imagine the potential cost of such a precedent . 
It is proof , as if we still needed it , of the fact that immature diplomacy , which defends no interests , unless of course they are individual interests , and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly NGOs , is not just inefficient , it is positively dangerous . 
Finally , a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report . 
Nowadays , let us face it , the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington . 
It was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened . 
The Corrie report missed this chance and we must , regrettably , punish it for losing so much . 
 . 
 ( PT ) Mr President , by way of both a conclusion and a summary , I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate . 
First of all , many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality , and increases poverty . 
This suggests that something must be done , failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or worsen . 
Secondly , it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context , taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality . 
I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union ' s role in international development policies is significant . 
Everyone recognises , indeed this was the theme of today ' s debate , that , if the European Union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level , it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development - related policies . 
I note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in EU policies is not a matter for the Council , for the Commission or for Parliament alone . 
Quite the contrary - it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in terms of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation , be it on the part of the Commission or of the Council , or even on the part of the European Parliament itself , and some Members have in fact already suggested that a monitoring centre or a working party could be established to monitor the impact of various policies in the specific area of development . 
Finally , I would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency ' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union ' s policies , and in particular in the context of its foreign policy . 
We believe that this is absolutely vital , failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies , and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe ' s status in the international system . 
For this reason it may be necessary , as I have stressed , to change the model and move away from the post - colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies . 
In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention , which succeeds the Lomé Convention , is an important instrument of renewal , and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process , as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle . 
 . I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate . 
I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion . 
We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence . 
This discussion is not new . 
We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it , as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence . 
I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda . 
This also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include , as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament , the setting up of a special intra - service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission . 
I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything . 
I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist , and we certainly do have them . 
Much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State , as has been very honestly said here in this House : people more or less identify with their spheres of interest , and all this is legitimate . 
I would , however , warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system . 
This exists , but it is only a small part of what we are discussing . 
The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on , and this is the problem . 
Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low . 
This is true in our part of the world , but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective . 
They farm , not just for a living , but in order to live , and this makes a difference . 
Subsistence farming is not based on price calculations , it is based on the hope of rain in the next season . 
This does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty - focusing which we need to deliver better than so far . 
From that perspective , what I am saying here is of deep relevance . 
Other issues have been mentioned : cattle - farming in Namibia , tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean . 
We should not be too masochistic . 
There is a limit to how useful that is . 
All these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of . 
The intervention prices have been regulated , and the problems we had with beef in Western Africa and in Namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support . 
These are real problems , but they have all been dealt with . 
As regards the issue of cacao , chocolate : I repeat that the 5 % has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries . 
What we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in Burkina Faso as coconuts for farmers in Ghana . 
This is not a clear case of incoherence , it is more a case of a competition between suppliers . 
What was mentioned concerning sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated . 
In the Overseas Countries and Territories Framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem , but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some European companies than with generating income in the Caribbean . 
In any case , this is a matter which we are currently dealing with . 
I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa . 
In all modesty , I would claim that this is something that documents that the Commission is willing to walk or fly the extra mile in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interests . 
We certainly have done our share to solve that problem , and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement . 
Finally , I thank you again for this debate . 
We will come back again with material on these issues , because these problems , in one way or another , are here to stay , simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally - defined trade interests , etc . 
We have to reconcile those different approaches . 
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson . 
I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure . 
The debate is closed . 
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 . 00 p . m . 
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission
The next item is the statement by the Council on EU priorities for the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission on 20 March 2000 . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the European Union played an active role in the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held in Geneva in March and April 1999 . 
It tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran , Iraq , in the Israeli settlements , in Burma / Myanmar , in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan , and negotiated statements to be issued on behalf of the chairman on Colombia and on East Timor . 
For the first time , the European Union tabled a resolution on the death penalty , which was enormously successful , and led work on a resolution concerning children ' s rights , which was a joint initiative with the Latin American group of countries . 
The Union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission to be held in Geneva in March and April . 
In particular , as agreed at the Human Rights Council Group on 9 February 2000 , the European Union intends to table draft resolutions on the Israeli settlements , Iran , Iraq , Sudan , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Burma / Myanmar , a draft chairman ' s statement on Colombia , and , possibly , on East Timor , together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries . 
The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March . 
In particular , there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty . 
To date , the group has not reached agreement on the strategy to be adopted in this respect , and in particular with regard to formulating a compromise to be tabled in the last resort in case of any amendments to the contrary , including Article 2 ( 7 ) of the Charter of the United Nations , which refers to sovereignty . 
We have tried to reach agreement in advance on a compromise text , in view of the difficulties that arose at the 1999 session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly , at which the Member States failed to agree on an amendment introducing a reference to Article 2 ( 7 ) into the draft resolution sponsored by the European Union on the death penalty . 
As you know , at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year , the United States decided , at a very late stage , to table a draft resolution on China . 
This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no - action motion . 
The European Union voted against that motion . 
The European Union ' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999 : there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co - sponsor a resolution on China , but an EU vote against the no - action motion . 
It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote . 
The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution . 
This initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China ' s part : the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union , in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States ' initiative . 
This initiative is being discussed within the Union , but with no hope of a decision in the near future . 
It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible , and in any case at least until after the EU - China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000 . 
In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission , we estimate the vote on the no - action motion will be close . 
It is therefore important this year , too , that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution . 
In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva . 
The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party , the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground , and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission , potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing . 
The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues , and whether or not it agrees with this initiative , this is in any case legitimate from this point of view . 
The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon , and will include seminars on legal issues and on women ' s rights , and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part . 
The next human rights seminar will be organised by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000 , and , during the last round of the dialogue in October 1999 , the Chinese side accepted the European Union ' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the United Nations International Pact on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations ' International Pact on Civil and Political Rights , both of which have been signed by the Chinese Government . 
The European Union is discussing issues on which it hopes that China will take concrete measures , and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union hopes China will announce positive measures at the session on 25 February . 
The presidency will also present to the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern . 
The meeting held in Beijing in October 1999 confirmed that , on the one hand , the Chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself , with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention . 
On the other hand , they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity . 
Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly ; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue , while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage . 
On various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue , and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas . 
It was decided that the dialogue should continue , but in a more targeted and effective way , given that China has agreed with the European Union ' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars . 
Lastly , during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the Commission itself . 
A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission ' s mechanisms . This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous , especially in the financial field . 
The European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission ' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level . 
 . Mr President , I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism , civil and political rights and the right to development . 
As the presidency said , much remains to be done , despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session . 
That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues . 
For example , discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament ' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases . 
It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult . 
That does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference . 
However , let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues : the death penalty , Cuba and China . 
I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks . 
We are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission . 
This has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly , I have always voted against the death penalty . 
Spurred on by Amnesty International and others , one of the first decisions I took as Governor of Hong Kong was to abolish the death penalty . 
We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly . 
We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid . 
The New York stage is different from Geneva . 
Last year ' s debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues . 
It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty . 
The debate in Geneva , however , is more focused on human rights issues . 
We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there . 
Secondly , Cuba . 
I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously . 
We are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom , moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty . 
We are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions . 
We are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of NGOs and the work of our human rights working group based in the EU embassies in Havana . 
We have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities , and this Parliament has done the same . 
But I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba . 
We want a fair and open society in Cuba , a Cuba which respects the principles of the market , the sanctity of contract and the rule of law . 
We want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
My views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which I wish to deal , namely China . 
Quite simply , I want us to be engaged with China . 
It would be self - indulgent and self - defeating , as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity , to want anything else . 
I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers . 
So what should we do ? 
Naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms . 
It is a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which does not include China - or Russia , for that matter . 
But I do not believe today , nor have I ever believed , that our burgeoning economic relationship with China - manifested , for example , by China ' s EUR 25 billion surplus with the European Union - should silence us when it comes to China ' s human rights record . 
For me the question is not whether we should address the question of human rights in China - we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in doing so - but rather what is the most effective way of doing this ? 
So what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year ? 
As the presidency has noted , the Union as a whole is considering its position . 
But I strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the Member States ought to take proper account . 
First , while some people question whether tabling a Geneva resolution makes any difference , several of the most distinguished Chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move , not least because of the message it sends to people in China itself . 
That is a point that deserves serious consideration . 
Secondly , we will all want to take proper account of what has actually been happening in China in recent months , for instance , the heavy sentences imposed on democracy campaigners , the detention and recent punishments meted out to members of Christian churches and the arrests and sentences of the members of Falun Gong . 
Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet . 
We have made our views very clear to them . 
While we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long - term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties , there is a dark side to the picture as well . 
Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China . 
That is true and potentially valuable , although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked . 
Of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres . 
That is very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level . 
Naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long - term process , but I wish I could point to more real gains . 
The next dialogue in Lisbon on 25 February will be an important test . 
It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not . 
What , finally , do we want to see as the first steps ? 
Well , for example , we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them . 
I wish we were closer to that . 
Where does all that leave us this year ? 
I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds . 
What I hope is , first , that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it , that we will not allow some to be picked off , that our position will not be based on self - delusion or pretence , that it will be a common position and a sensible position . 
I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions . 
But if that is true , then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward . 
If we are to rest our position on the human rights dialogue , then we need to be able to convince you , the NGO community and the public at large that it is actually getting somewhere . 
That , in my judgement , is the challenge for the next few weeks . 
I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world , and particularly in China . 
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten . 
We will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission and proceed to the vote . 
Welcome
I am delighted to welcome a delegation of the Hong Kong Legislative Council to Parliament . 
 ( Loud applause ) 
VOTE
 . 
As Mrs Wallström explained during yesterday ' s debate , the Commission is able to accept the following amendments : Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 13 . The Commission can also accept Amendment No 4 in principle . 
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 , 5 , 6 , 12 , 14 , 18 and 16 . 
 ( The President declared the common position approved as amended ) 
Report ( A5 - 0023 / 2000 ) by Mr Böge , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91 / 68 / EEC as regards scrapie ( COM ( 1998 ) 623 - C4 - 0026 / 1999 - 1998 / 0324 ( COD ) ) 
 ( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) 
Recommendation ( A5 - 0008 / 2000 ) by Ms Cederschiöld , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the proposal for a Council decision on the approval , on behalf of the European Community , of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty ( 11221 / 1999 - COM ( 1998 ) 249 - C5 - 0222 / 1999 - 1998 / 0141 ( AVC ) ) 
 ( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) 
Report ( A5 - 0015 / 2000 ) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70 / 524 / EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs ( COM ( 1999 ) 388 - C5 - 0134 / 1999 - 1999 / 0168 ( CNS ) ) 
Before the final vote : 
 . 
 ( DE ) Mr President , following this vote , I would like to ask the competent Commissioner , Mr Byrne , if , now that he has seen how much support there is in this Chamber , he is prepared to adopt the proposed amendments ? 
 . I regret to say that I believe that the thought - out position I advanced yesterday is the correct position . 
The comprehensive approach that the Commission intends to adopt on this issue will be brought forward as soon as possible under Article 152 where Parliament will have a codecision function . 
That is the appropriate way of dealing with this . 
Mr President , in accordance with Article 69 ( 2 ) , I call for referral back to committee . 
The reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure , as proposed by the Commission . 
We have accepted this but have proposed further approximations of the legal effect measures that affect this directive , in particular the adoption of a text - which has been approved by the Commission overall - for the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms . 
We take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time , but the Commission will not adopt this . 
I believe that , in accordance with Article 69 ( 2 ) , we must endeavour to enter into discussion with the Commission , and I would therefore urge my fellow MEPs to decide in favour of referral back to committee . 
 ( Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee ) 
Report ( A5 - 0034 / 2000 ) by Ms Stenzel , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States establishing the guidelines for Community Initiative Programmes ( CIPs ) for which the Member States are invited to submit proposals for support under the EQUAL initiative ( COM ( 1999 ) 476 - C5 - 0260 / 1999 - 1999 / 2186 ( COS ) ) 
Before the vote : 
Mr President , permit me to say quite publicly to Mrs Stenzel , who is a member of the ÖVP executive , that many MEPs are horrified that you have entered into a coalition with Haider , and that we wish to denounce you for doing so ! 
 ( Applause from the left . Heckling from the right ) 
 . 
 ( DE ) Mr Cohn - Bendit , I do not think that the European Parliament has any business intervening to such a huge extent in a country ' s domestic politics , in the way that you are doing . 
I can speak for my party , which championed Austria ' s membership of the European Union in the early days . 
As a political force , we serve to guarantee that Austria will continue to embrace European values . 
I refuse to allow myself to be ostracised for internal and party political reasons ! 
This does not reflect the truth of the situation but is pure propaganda . 
I utterly reject this ! 
 ( Loud , sustained applause from the centre and from the right , protests from the left ) 
Welcome
This is perhaps an appropriate moment to welcome to the official gallery , a delegation of four members of the Moroccan parliament , led by Mr Brahim Rachidi , Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives . 
We are honoured by the visit of this delegation which is taking place shortly before the entry into force on 1 March 2000 of the Association Agreement between Morocco and the European Union . 
On this historic occasion we welcome these developments in our relations and the prospects for closer ties between our two parliaments . 
It is in this spirit that the delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries will be visiting Morocco on 20 to 22 March . 
I hope the delegation has an excellent visit to Strasbourg . 
 ( Loud applause ) 
Mr President , I just want to take advantage of your welcome to the delegation by pointing out that the House also has the pleasure of welcoming the heads of the Austrian anti - racist associations who are honouring us with a visit .

VOTE ( continuation ) 
We shall now continue with the vote on the Stenzel report on the EQUAL initiative ( A5 - 0034 / 2000 ) . 
 ( Parliament adopted the resolution ) 
Recommendation for second reading : 
 ( A5 - 0027 / 2000 ) by Ms Lienemann , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy ( 9085 / 3 / 1999 - C5 - 0209 / 1999 - 1997 / 0067 ( COD ) ) 
Before the vote : 
 .  ( FR ) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE . 
I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries , whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean , countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries . 
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have , for the most part , been retained in the common position adopted by the Council . 
As far as the third phase of LIFE ( 2000 - 2004 ) is concerned , the instrument is to be divided into three sections , LIFE - Nature ( 47 % of the resources ) , LIFE - Environment ( 47 % ) and LIFE - Third Countries ( 6 % ) . 
In my opinion , the most important amendments concern the following : 
LIFE ' s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment , particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies , as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment ; 
Improving the efficiency , transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE , procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public , and procedures for cooperation between recipients ; 
The objectives of LIFE : this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development , in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative , on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere ; 
The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities , and thus job creation . 
I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe . 
The other candidate countries ( e . g . Cyprus , Turkey , Malta ) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries . 
The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies , of course , in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme ( 2000 - 2004 ) . 
The Commission proposal , ratified by the Council , is for EUR 613 million , whilst the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million . 
I support Mrs Lienemann ' s firm stance . 
The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created , even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement . 
If the report is adopted in plenary session , then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened , in accordance with the codecision procedure , in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme . 
This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions ! 
Böge report ( A5 - 0023 / 2000 ) 
 .  ( FR ) As an MEP and , more importantly , as a consumer , I welcome the European Commission ' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union . 
This proposal has two objectives : first , to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and , secondly , to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( TSE ) or BSE - type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species . 
What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie . 
What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow - up report on the mad cow crisis . 
I also consider it essential , for the sake of coherence , that existing legislation on scrapie , which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals , should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union , rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs . 
These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie . 
A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic . 
Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective , especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie , it is still a notable improvement . 
It is a pledge to European citizens , who have voiced their concern , as regards European food policy , on many occasions . 
The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard . 
As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution , traceability , responsibility and transparency , the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety . 
This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence . 
It is up to us , as responsible Europeans , to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive . 
Cederschiöld report ( A5 - 0008 / 2000 ) 
Mr President , I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament . 
In my view , products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products , namely , those that can be seen and touched . The fruits of the intellect and science , which are intangible , are of inestimable importance . 
Therefore , the European Community should be more energetic in providing practical encouragement , not just through upholding patents but through concessions and other forms of support for scientists who are striving , through the knowledge and experience they have acquired , to give future generations something better than that which they have today . 
 .  ( DA ) We oppose , on principle , the European Community ' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the Member States . 
We are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the Member States and the Community . 
At the same time , we appreciate the fact that the WIPO treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of distributors and practising artists . 
We are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation . 
 -  ( DE ) The Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because , in the plenary debate of the previous day , Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties . 
In institutional terms , there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties . 
In addition , there is a clear tendency , in matters of international jurisdiction , more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction . 
When it is , then , still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision - making processes , the question of legitimacy arises . 
Moreover , the concept of ' author ' is not defined in the Treaties . 
In this regard , too , the Commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on , and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others . 
One of the trickiest aspects is the public interest : will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture ? 
And , finally , the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified . Regarding this , too , there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission . 
If nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation , then we must at least abstain from voting . 
Graefe zu Baringdorf ( A5 - 0015 / 2000 ) 
 . 
 ( PT ) Food safety issues are in the spotlight following the BSE and dioxin scandals . 
GMOs are still the subject of great uncertainty , both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health . 
The precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty . 
The use of biotechnology needs to be studied in greater depth and not just " packaged " for immediate sale to boost the profits of a few multinationals in this sector . 
The profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises . 
This is the context that the rapporteur finds himself working in , making a legal link between the issue of GMOs and feedingstuffs , and noting that the latter " shall be authorised only if . . . safe for human health and the environment "  . 
Furthermore , he considers that " genetically modified additives shall be clearly identified as such on any label or any document , official or otherwise , which is affixed to or accompanies the additive "  . 
This will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer ' s freedom of choice . 
In view of the Montreal Protocol on Genetically Modified Organisms ( GMOs ) , I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report , and I have therefore voted in favour of it . 
Stenzel report ( A5 - 0034 / 2000 ) 
Mr President , I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote , on behalf of the PPE Group on the EQUAL report . 
We have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the Socialist Group . 
The Socialist Group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been . 
This is why we are abstaining . 
We want to ensure that the EQUAL report , which is very important for refugees , the elderly , the handicapped and women , simply goes ahead . 
It is regrettable that , due to the procedure , the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session . 
I am convinced that the rapporteur ' s nationality has played a certain role , which should not be of relevance in this Parliament . 
This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament . 
These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report . 
We want EQUAL to go ahead . 
We assent to the main thrust of it , but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage . 
Mr President , as the representative of the Pensioners ' Party in the European Parliament , I abstained in the vote on the EQUAL initiative because , although it provides more support than in the past for projects aimed at combating age discrimination , its proposals are not sufficiently trenchant or specific . 
I also abstained for another reason . I think the time has come for the European institutions to stop experimenting and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give European citizens some firm indication regarding what Europe wants Europe to be . 
The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice . 
 .  ( DA ) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for EU initiative programmes ( CIP ) . 
Basically , we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but , since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used , we have simply adopted a position on the issue . 
We think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report . 
 .  ( FR ) We did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market . 
Nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague , all too pie in the sky . 
And yet , in the chapter on aid and training for refugees , the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to " refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention "  . 
This restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout Europe are in a drastic situation , with no protection , forced to work on the black market , and to hide , while so - called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down . 
The first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of pariahs , the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment , the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion . 
 . I voted in favour of Mrs Stenzel ' s report on the EQUAL initiative as I believe that it is essential to continue the work begun under the previous NOW , HORIZON , YOUTHSTART and INTEGRA strands of the ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT initiatives . 
The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on . 
EQUAL stands for " equality "  . 
It must be seen to deliver . 
I welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market . 
I also favour the desire to move away from an out - dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment . 
There must be flexibility . 
I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative . 
In the last programming period 9 % of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives . 
The figure is now 5 . 35 % . 
This means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated . 
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopted several of the amendments I put forward , concerning for example , the emphasis on access to start - up capital , how to exploit new business opportunities in cities , towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business . 
This often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities . 
The positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process . 
I also stressed the need for prevention . 
The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted . 
There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority . 
There must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets . 
While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way , overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported . 
 . 
 ( PT ) The Commission intends to use the Community initiative EQUAL to replace the Community EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT initiatives and various subprogrammes in these areas , such as NOW , on new opportunities for women , HORIZON , for disabled persons , YOUTHSTART , for promoting the labour market integration of young people , and INTEGRA , for groups threatened with exclusion . 
Unfortunately , this involves a significant reduction in appropriations . 
Accordingly , the Commission will use this initiative to develop what it considers to be new ways of fighting discrimination and inequality of all kinds in the labour market , based on the four pillars of the employment policy guidelines . 
This is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations . 
However , in order to give this new approach some chance of success , the Commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal , a more simple and direct one , involving the NGOs from the outset , so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way . 
The Commission did not do that . 
We hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned . 
 .  ( FR ) We welcome the fact that the European Parliament is continuing its initiatives to fight discrimination and inequality , and the four areas included in the EQUAL programme - employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunities for men and women - would appear to be genuinely relevant . 
However , this report , although probably inspired by the best intentions , occasionally takes a direction which I feel is highly dangerous in that it tends to erase notions of citizenship and legality and turns a multiplicity of exceptions into the common law on which the Community approach is based . 
Even if one cannot but applaud the decision to adopt specific measures to eradicate all forms of discrimination on the labour market , which might affect asylum seekers whom life has already , by definition , treated badly , we still need to keep a legal conception of this notion : to put it plainly , where there is every reason to help asylum seekers who follow the correct procedure and are duly recognised as such , the same does not apply to the numerous categories listed in the report , namely applicants , those under temporary protection and those denied refugee status and threatened with repatriation , for whom the report makes provision for identical assistance . 
There is a risk that the so - called aid measures provided for in the report will spread insidiously and with disastrous results : asylum seekers , of course , plus asylum seekers under temporary protection while their applications are being processed and asylum seekers whose applications have been rejected and who are threatened with expulsion should all , according to the report , be able to benefit from this set of measures , whereas their very status - after all , what is an asylum seeker who has been refused refugee status and who is threatened with expulsion if not an illegal immigrant - should , at least for the last category , exclude them from a policy to integrate them into a Community which does not acknowledge their presence in its midst as legal or legitimate . 
Whether we like it or not , a signal of this sort would be a fearful invitation to immigrants who , merely by applying for refugee status , irrespective of whether or not it is granted , would be able to qualify for a range of aid measures designed to help them integrate permanently into the labour market , in a general climate of shortage , in which the legal population , both foreign and indigenous , is cruelly aware of the problem of unemployment . 
Consequently , despite its general approach , which cannot but be endorsed , I am unable to support a report which contains in it the seed of a new attack on the concepts of citizenship and republican legitimacy which I hold so dear . 
Lieneman report ( A5 - 0027 / 2000 ) 
Mr President , some of us in Parliament will remember the successful film ,  " Cocoon " , in which some elderly people drank a special kind of water that made them young again . 
In my view , it is , therefore , immensely important to exercise extreme vigilance over the water we all drink and , consequently , to study and approve the provisions referred to here . 
For that reason , I approved these measures , but I should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water purity at the point where it enters our houses , to ensure that it is of the highest level . 
In the measures that have been adopted , I note that support for people who purify their water in their own homes has been omitted . I trust that this will be remedied in the future . 
Apart from Amendment No 76 , which was an error , since I intended to vote in favour , the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following fictional situation : 
Supposed draft environmental directive :  " European Parliament and Council Directive establishing the obligation to maintain , during winter , a temperature of no less than eighteen degrees centigrade in the streets , squares and parks of the cities of Europe " . 
Guidelines of the Directive : a ) each city shall provide the means , in terms of energy and technology , sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012 ; b ) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices . 
Opinion of an MEP from the north of Europe :  " This Directive would be unfair since , for example , the cost for an inhabitant of Stockholm would be two hundred times greater than the cost for an inhabitant of Naples " . 
Opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe :  " Nevertheless , this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions " . 
 ( End of fiction ) . 
In explaining my vote , I must say that it is positive that there is a Community directive on water , but I believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of Europe , but will lead to legislative caricature . 
We cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts , such as the Mediterranean countries , and countries with northern levels of rainfall . 
Furthermore , it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfers of water , between different river basins , practically impossible in the future . 
Once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union . 
 .  ( FR ) Drinking , eating , washing , farming - water irrigates each act of our daily life and we treat it , wrongly , as an unfailing and inexhaustible resource . 
A simple gesture such as turning on a tap seems to bring water straight from the source . 
But the source is threatening to run dry . 
Scientific studies are now no more than a formality : water will be the main resource at stake in years to come , starting tomorrow . 
But tomorrow will be too late . 
We have to lay down the rules of play today , before we all lose . 
In adopting the water directive on Wednesday 15 February , the European Parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water , coastal wasters , inland waters and groundwater . 
Europe now has a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water , promote its sustainable use , protect eco - systems , help fight floods and droughts and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances . 
We have thrown water a life - belt . 
 .  ( FR ) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy . 
The ecological disaster on the banks of the Danube is a reminder , as if we needed one , that all too often human negligence jeopardises natural resources such as water . 
The objective of this proposal for a directive , which dates back to 1997 , is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water , coastal waters , inland waters and groundwater . 
It provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration , protect ecosystems , promote sustainable water use , help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances . 
Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework . 
The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy . 
The proposal for a directive was amended twice , first in 1997 and then in 1998 . 
A technical working party made up of Council and Parliament representatives met in January 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions . 
However , the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments , most of which I support . 
As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned , the Council ' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive , while the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years . 
The committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020 , the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020 . 
The Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years , but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years . 
All the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years , not 16 . 
I must say that I support these reduced deadlines , especially as provision is made for derogations . 
As far as costs are concerned , I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources . 
I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012 . 
I will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment , which needs no further comment :  " Water is not a commercial product like any other but , rather , a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the European Union and which must be protected , defended and treated as such "  . 
 . I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote . 
We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water . 
There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur . 
However , the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which , under the rules of subsidiarity , should be left to the Member States for decision . 
In my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue . 
In Ireland all the major users of water , commercial , industrial and agricultural , already pay for their use of water . 
This is a decision of national and local government , and this is where all future decisions should be retained . 
These are the main reasons for my vote . 
 . The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long - term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters . 
I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy . 
However , I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used . 
Water , in this context , is a commercial commodity . 
It is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life .
