The environmental label must and will signal to third countries a whole range of important environmental concepts : that adverse effects on the environment can be reduced in the manufacture of certain product groups ; that common goals for environmentally friendly consumption should be promoted ; and that the relevant international standards must be observed . 
Economic globalisation has already made it possible for developing countries to share in the prosperity of rich countries and will continue to do so in the future . 
However , one thing must be made clear from the outset , and the common position before us does just that : the same rules must apply for all states . 
If the production plants in a country are required to meet the criteria for the environmental label , then this applies to all the production plants where the product in question is manufactured . 
If we can achieve this , then we will have globalised an important environmental principle .
