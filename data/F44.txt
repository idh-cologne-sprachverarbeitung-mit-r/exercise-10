Madam President , I asked for the floor before the sitting started in order to say something solely intended for you as President of this House . We have a procedure for visits to be made to this House to report on certain situations . 
I do respect and agree with this procedure , as I also agree with the freedom of expression for everyone . However , for the second time in a fortnight these visits have been used to attack individuals , political parties , including my own , and institutions . 
I feel that this behaviour , particularly in your presence , is unacceptable and totally repugnant , especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign . 
Therefore , particularly out of respect for you , I must say that I do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this . 
I was told that this was a personal response . 
Note will be taken of it in the Minutes .
