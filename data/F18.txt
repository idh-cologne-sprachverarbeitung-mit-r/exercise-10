Madam President , we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as , fortunately , are a great many other Members too . 
The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too . 
Because what is it that unites us in Europe ? Surely it is the values and principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights , more than anything . 
The Austrian Freedom Party leader , Mr Haider , has repeatedly repudiated these values . 
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness . 
He is a dangerous man . 
The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme - right voters but never to negotiate with extreme - right leaders . 
Values should take precedence over power . 
We deplore , therefore , what is happening in Austria . In fact , we were shaken by it . 
We are extremely disappointed . As a last resort , we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternatives . 
We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty . 
We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right . 
If , despite this , the coalition goes ahead , we would urge the ÖVP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes , both in word and deed . 
Madam President , Austria awaits a heavy responsibility . 
Madam President , it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics , but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics . 
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself ? 
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here ? 
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days ? 
From all accounts , this would only serve to strengthen Haider . 
Who would want this to happen ? 
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics ? 
Europe is a community of law . 
Democracy , respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold . 
One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them , and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians , by virtue of their political culture , voted as they did . 
It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President - in - Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did , and in a manner that goes against the Treaty . 
It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic , constitutional and well - known European party , so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community , and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation , and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take ! 
 ( Applause ) 
Madam President , they say , where I come from ,  ' it ' s three times for a Welshman '  , and three times , as I think you will discover in the course of that debate , I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent , and on several occasions , a moving debate . 
First of all , could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday . 
I must respond also to the fact , of course , that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity , the complacency and the fragility of the Commission ' s opinion . 
I am duty - bound to say to this House , there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered , or indeed the action taken , by the Commission on this issue . 
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement , as did the President this afternoon , to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday . 
Secondly , we said , in very specific terms , that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria . 
Thirdly , we expressed , in very explicit terms , that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty ; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld . 
There is no complacency , no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all . 
And , when I say that the Commission took that view , I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler , who is from Austria ; and who , once again , demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission , under oath , in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning . 
Anyone , therefore , who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian , should examine their own motives in the context of a debate , which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world . 
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague , Franz Fischler . 
Could I also say , Madam President , that the understanding of the presidency , the Portuguese presidency , for our position , was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by Mr Da Costa when he said , and I quote him , that ' Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation '  . 
That surely is in everyone ' s interests . 
In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine , we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday . 
We will continue to do that , Madam President , without fear or favour . 
That is our duty . 
It is also a matter of conviction . 
My final point is this . We understand the context of this essential debate . 
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider ' s offensive statements , the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies , sometimes on successive days . 
We understand that , and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism . 
And , when we recall that , like many others on all sides of this House , my and my colleagues ' instincts are naturally aroused . 
However , the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct . 
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning . 
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law . 
Without fragility , without complacency , without ambiguity , but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people . 
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate ,  ' necessarily with acute vigilance '  . 
I wonder , since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber , whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government . 
Does the Commission support the Council ? 
Madam President , when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view , I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning , as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue , it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States . 
Thank you , Commissioner Kinnock . 
I think that we have just had a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it . 
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . 
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed . 
The vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow . 
Recourse to the precautionary principle
The next item is the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle . 
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle , and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen . 
The precautionary principle is not a new concept . 
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas , environmental , human , animal and plant health ; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht . 
It also appears in a range of international texts , for example , the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio - Safety Protocol . 
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear . 
It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear , but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action . 
However , the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years . 
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary . 
In view of this growing interest , the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle . 
The basic aim of the communication is twofold . 
To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles . 
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism . 
The Commission ' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental , human , animal and plant health . 
Of course , this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures , but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear . 
As such , while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science , as some have alleged , it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics . 
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision - makers are prepared to accept for society . 
It is therefore political by nature . 
However , the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper . 
Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is , we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut . 
They must be non - discriminatory in their application , that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin . 
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken . 
For example , if one product has been approved , similar products should also be approved . 
Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action ; that is , the measures should be cost - effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment , that is the burden of proof . 
All these elements have to apply cumulatively . 
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures , which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle . For example , a research programme , public information campaigns , recommendations and so on . 
Applying the precautionary principle does not , therefore , automatically imply a ban . 
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue ; however , it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use . 
By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle , we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level . 
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you very much for your statement . 
I have three short questions , the first being as follows . 
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice . 
Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry , Foreign Trade , Competition and the Internal Market ? 
I am sure that your answer to this will be " yes " but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be ? 
My next question , Mrs Wallström , is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation ; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors , for example ? 
Lastly , will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation ? 
In other words , will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached ? 
 . Thank you very much , Dagmar Roth - Behrendt , for these questions . 
Of course , this is shared by the whole Commission . 
This is a common communication which was written by the three of us , David Byrne , Erkki Liikanen and myself , but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today . 
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission . 
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document . 
Yes , I would say we already use this way of working with different , difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example . 
And , I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle . 
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys ; and of course , we apply it in several different environmental areas . 
It has been mainly used in the environmental field , but , of course also when it comes to human health . 
So , we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it . 
Mr President , Commissioner , regarding the relationship between science , on the one hand , and applying the precautionary principle on the other , the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence . 
Needless to say , this accords science a great deal of power . 
We might ask ourselves , what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for ? 
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied , provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists . I would like to ask , what is , then , the definition of a recognised minority ? 
How would you describe this ? 
What establishes a recognised minority ? 
If a political decision is involved , I would also like to ask : who takes this political decision ? 
The Commission ? 
The Council ? 
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this ? 
What is the role of the scientific committees ? 
What , also , will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up ? 
Finally , will this whole decision - making process be carried out in a transparent , public way ? 
These are my three questions . 
 . Yes , Mr President , that is true . 
There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear , but I will try to answer some questions . 
Who will take the decision , who are the decision - makers ? 
Well , that depends on who the legislators are . 
This is part of risk management . 
They have to look at , for example , the concerns of people in relation to a special issue , and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case . 
However , it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle . 
It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete . 
That is , of course , where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science . 
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done , but there is no question of changing the scientific base . 
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision ; and that should also be done in the future . 
You have to see this as a tool for risk management . 
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger , for example , or if you want to protect the environment ; and you have to look at the science that is available . 
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science . 
Then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not . 
So , there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today . 
Mr President , I have a question concerning an actual , concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle . 
It is about brominated flame retardants . 
It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered . There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment . 
There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks , while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are . 
Recently , both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants . 
I am wondering , therefore , if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative . 
 . 
 ( SV ) Mr President , thank you very much , Mr Sjöstedt , for this question . 
The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one . 
It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done . 
We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do . 
Allow me to remind you , however , that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban . 
There may be a series of different measures which can be taken . 
It ought not , therefore , to be immediately interpreted as a ban . 
Where brominated flame retardants are concerned , there may eventually be a ban , but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken . 
This issue is extremely topical . 
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done . 
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier . 
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean ? 
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone - treated beef and genetically modified crops . 
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do ? 
 . 
 ( SV ) Mr President , I am pleased to be able to tell you that , in Montreal , we have just signed a protocol concerning bio - safety . 
We succeeded there in agreeing , at an international forum , as to the definition of the precautionary principle . 
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol . 
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle . We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted . 
It is , moreover , also accepted as an important and effective tool . 
Mr President , I have two questions . 
I shall try to be very brief indeed . 
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle . 
As I have understood it , there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood . 
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out , including a cost - benefit analysis ? 
In that case , I am rather concerned , because the idea was really that a cost - benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced . 
Instead , the precautionary principle should come first . 
My second question concerns the burden of proof . 
I remember Margot Wallström being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee . 
At that time , she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof . In other words , a product ' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous . 
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now . 
 .  ( SV ) Thank you , Mrs Schörling . 
These are two important questions , and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them . 
No , one must not begin by carrying out a cost - benefit analysis . Instead , the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know , of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals . 
When , on the other hand , the decision has been made to take a certain measure , the one chosen ought to be cost - effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness . 
It is not , therefore , the case that one must begin with a cost - benefit analysis . 
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof . 
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases . 
I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this . 
There , however , we are concerned with that particular area , whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern . 
Therefore , the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context . Instead , it is a question of political decision - making and of the bases for this . 
It is , however , perfectly correct that , when it comes , for example , to chemicals , we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof . 
Mr President , I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work , otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible . 
I will give an example : a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind . It is therefore a teratogenic substance . 
Very well , it is a fungicide , it kills off mould . 
This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory , perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests . 
Now , in my opinion , given that this is such a serious risk to health , the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market , which New Zealand has done , for example . 
So I want to put this question to you . When human health is at stake , or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected , should we not perhaps carry out a cost - benefit analysis ? 
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high ; there are no benefits that can compensate for this . 
In short , Commissioner , I would therefore like to know whether in this case , the precautionary principle as you understand it , would in any case , require the product to be taken off the market , until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary . 
 . 
 ( SV ) Mr President , no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people ' s health and the environment . 
Obviously , I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here , but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case . 
The truth , of course , is that a great many Member States , and no doubt other nations too , have taken measures to protect their populations ' health which amount to using the precautionary principle , even if it has not always been called that . 
Naturally , it is not in the first place a question of cost ; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided . 
Nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure . 
I think , however , it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken , it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between . 
In those circumstances , consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result . 
I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost - effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it , namely when I was on a visit to Africa . 
At a hospice for AIDS patients , I met two Irish Catholic nuns who were caring for dying AIDS patients . 
They were the first to say that , each day , they must think about doing what is most cost - effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there . 
We must be very careful about how we use resources . 
I believe we can learn something from this . 
We must , of course , always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help . 
As is also explained in the present communication , it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost - benefit analysis . 
Consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge , and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people ' s health . 
Mr President , it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions ! 
Commissioner , I would like to come back again to my first question , when I asked about the other Commissioners , for it may have sounded as though I was in jest . 
Indeed you responded in kind , as I knew you would do . 
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked , that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union . 
I have good reason for asking this . 
As you rightly said , the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where , as yet , there is no scientific evidence . 
How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time , for example by our partners in the USA , on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes ? 
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy , will not , as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors , keep pulling the carpet from underneath you ? 
That is exactly what it is all about , otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here , Commissioner ! 
Mr President , I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication ' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons . 
I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts , for example with the United States . 
We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise . 
Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal , we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment , health and trade . 
This constitutes a good example , therefore . 
We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too , but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily . 
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle , and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it , something which is clearly established in the present communication . 
Thank you , Commissioner . 
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed , so to speak , as more than an ordinary aspect of administration , even though , as we have been able to establish from the interventions , questions and replies , it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance . 
The debate is closed . 
Intergovernmental Conference
The next item is the report ( A5 - 0018 / 2000 ) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference [ 14094 / 1999 - C5 - 0341 / 1999 - 1999 / 0825 ( CNS ) ] . 
Mr President , I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts . 
Let me also once more thank my co - rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration . 
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important , both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement . 
The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century . 
For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively , more democratically and with complete transparency , clearly what we need is an extensive and in - depth reform of the institutions and the way they work . 
The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work . 
From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit , it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe , one that is more effective , more democratic and more transparent . 
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union ' s institutional bodies . 
I will not repeat which ones , because everyone knows . 
My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved , namely enlargement . 
Granted this , the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which , properly addressed , would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union ' s institutions . 
Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which , for that very reason , are highly visible to the European public . 
In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference . 
At the same time , however , I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform , I repeat , of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health , energy , culture , transport and even tourism . 
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency , which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end . 
All the same , whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference . 
This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union ' s Member States . 
In light of what I have said , I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you , so that on 14 February , the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos , can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament ' s backing . 
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us . 
Mr President , the Group of the European People ' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki . 
It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content , because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and , specifically , the protocol on the Union ' s institutions . 
In Helsinki , the governments approved the idea that , as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States , a minimal reform would be sufficient . With more than 21 , a deeper reform would become necessary . 
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States . 
It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform . 
We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union . 
Having said this , Mr President , this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference . 
In theory , we could have done so . 
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th . 
However , we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place , precisely in order to facilitate enlargement . 
Mr President , I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly . 
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament ' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues . 
Mr President , I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself . 
However , the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference . 
This is for one very simple reason : according to the agreements made in Helsinki , this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues , which are currently decided unanimously , being decided by a qualified majority . 
Therefore , the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase . 
It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament . 
Therefore , since the qualified majority will be extended , there will also be more codecision with Parliament . 
However , this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union . 
That it is what we are doing . 
We believe that , in the political design of the Union , other issues need to be dealt with . 
These include , amongst others , the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues , which have made much progress recently , but which must be incorporated into the Treaty . 
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and work began on its wording yesterday , which I believe has started very positively . 
We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union ' s institutions . 
Therefore , Mr President , our proposals , which we will specify in another report , together with the proposals of the Commission , which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents . 
We will talk about this on another day . 
Today we must give the green light to this conference , and , for its part , the Group of the European People ' s Party , Mr President , is ready to give that green light . 
Mr President , for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee . 
We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened . 
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term , because they are very important subjects in themselves . 
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC . 
These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC . 
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study . 
They need a political deal . 
It is more a question of nine minutes , perhaps nine hours if it is difficult , locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects , not nine months . 
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda . 
There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at , especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries . 
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree . 
Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated . 
However , there are six , seven , eight , nine perhaps , subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address . 
There is time . 
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act . 
It lasted only five months . 
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year . 
Only the Amsterdam Treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason . 
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda . 
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view . 
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles . 
I thank the Commission for doing that even if , of course , I do not agree with everything the Commission said . 
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward . 
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that . 
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC . 
That is all to the good . 
The Parliament , the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda . 
I wish you every success , President of the Council , in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine ' s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion , also when the French Presidency takes over , by the end of this year . 
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted . 
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner . 
It makes it impossible for those same Member States , at the IGC , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights . 
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States , especially Britain and France , seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty . 
It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty . 
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court . 
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention . 
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy . 
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent . 
Mr President , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament ' s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the Council , and in the end , makes it rather irrelevant . 
We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion , and frankly , we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine ' s day , the first day of the Strasbourg part - session . 
Moreover , given that this opinion is quite important , we can still vote for it , and indeed , the majority of our group will be voting for it . 
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform . 
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States . 
It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that , in any case , the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act , and to prevent and rectify the course of events . 
We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference , and I firmly hope that this opinion , that was given reluctantly , will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise , but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament . 
Mr President , Mr President - in - Office of the Council , Commissioner , to my mind , it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful . 
After all , we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance , that is to say , we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States , and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future . 
How , though , is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now , i . e . before enlargement takes place ? 
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference . 
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future . 
My group , Mr President - in - Office of the Council , noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs . 
You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand . 
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe , and , in particular , a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs , because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns , the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians . 
The politics of closed doors and private discussions ; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all . 
That is why we need transparency . 
I believe it falls to you , as President - in - Office of the Council , to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before , leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties . 
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going , and its outcome , rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent . 
We also take the view that the political decision - makers must at long last change the habit of a life - time and ask the citizens in referenda , once the Intergovernmental Conference is over , whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future . 
In this way , Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy . 
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to . 
As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights , I wish to make the following point clear : neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter . 
After all , what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals ? 
No , to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union . 
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone . 
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen ; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union . 
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens , and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year . 
Of course , we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States . 
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform , as the Council has resolved to do , and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny . 
We need bold change and , at the same time , we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States . 
This is something I would stress , particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States . 
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament , on all the issues you have raised . 
There is one final issue I would like to raise . 
Parliament ' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy . 
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies , but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision - making processes . 
What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union ' s policies to date . 
It is all about creating a socially just Europe . 
A socially just Europe is still highly topical , for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union ' s policies . 
Hence , to my mind , that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty , which defines the Union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition . The same applies to Article 105 , in my view , for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty , of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment . 
Mr President , the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , as set by the Helsinki Council , i . e . focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe , must be adhered to . 
It must be adhered to in the interests of the fast , effective work of the conference , prior to enlargement . 
This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission , which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and , what is more , widen it in the wrong direction , i . e . moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system . 
Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which , when taken together , form a real alternative resolution . 
In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision - making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty . 
We deplore the fact that the Commission , in its opinion of 26 January , limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised Europe enlarging towards the East , a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions . 
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint , but this is a totally superficial concept . 
Quite the opposite , in an enlarged Europe , Mr President , the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding . 
Furthermore , the centralised European system , as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation , erodes nations and , in eroding nations , erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves . 
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker , as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending . 
This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised , i . e . by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty . 
We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles , one which are still , unfortunately , outside the European Parliament and the Commission . 
A flexible Europe , is a Europe which respects its national democracies , which relies on the support of its nations , its national patriotisms , instead of continually persecuting them . 
It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats , not the constraining , convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference . 
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament ' s opinion is . 
It is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further European integration . I say this without being the slightest bit ironical about the highly respectable position of Mr Berthu and his group , but it is no coincidence that the European Council ' s decision is supported by those who are , after all , in Parliament because - and this is a highly respectable position - they are fighting against further integration . 
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council . 
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliments to those already offered - can convey Parliament ' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine ' s day . In any case , tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda . 
This message must be very clear ; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow . 
We shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the IGC on 14 February , but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content . 
Just consider the facts : we looked at Austria a while ago , but we can also look at the stock markets , Mr President : given that the euro , that great undertaking , has fallen 16 % against the dollar in a year , then perhaps , I will not say a government , but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues . 
There is clearly a more ambitious goal . 
We Radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text , and for example , to request - just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done , i . e . , that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty . 
We know that there are other topics : for example , many Members have subscribed , along with us , to the issue of the seat of the institutions , an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level . 
In conclusion , I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide - ranging for once , so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency , this agenda will be revised . Otherwise , the challenge really would be lost , not just for the present but also for many years to come . 
Mr President , the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference . 
He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but , in the Commission ' s draft , plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision - making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market . This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels , even if a unanimous French National Assembly , a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this . 
And , in this regard , you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people ' s social conditions , which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls . 
These are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day . 
Brussels knows best . 
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency , but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step , and that is not only my assessment , but also that of the European Ombudsman . 
Today , the Commission is obliged , on a case - by - case basis , to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people ' s demands for , and expectation of , transparency and , if the Commission ' s regulation is adopted , the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration . 
There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States . 
Under the banner of " progress towards transparency "  , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public . 
It is , of course , thoroughly Orwellian . 
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not , at the same time , available for critical scrutiny by the public . 
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism , for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission ' s possession . There follows , however , a long , long list of exceptions , and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions . 
The French text contains the word " refuse " and the English text the word " shall "  , which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public , for example in my own country . 
In addition , we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions , which may be used for any purposes whatsoever . It is therefore . . . 
 ( The President cut the speaker off ) 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Portuguese Council Presidency ' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well - considered ideas and a high degree of openness . 
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve . 
The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track , although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament ' s motions are anything to go by . 
There is more to be said on that score . 
It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick ; that of the power to act , democratic legitimacy and transparency . 
In the end , it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens . 
At the same time of course , we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union . 
If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is . 
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade . 
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre - requisite to the European Union ' s being able to function come what may . 
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned , and legislation and in relation to treaties , which entail changes being made to legislation . 
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament ' s corresponding powers in this area . 
In addition , we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union , for there is a lack of supervision in this area . 
The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting , when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council , which is an unacceptable way to go on . 
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann , I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank . 
However , there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side . 
Furthermore , the tripartite relationship of Commission , Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy , where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case , especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures , for which the Commission alone has responsibility . 
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this . 
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference . 
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter , perhaps to extend the mandate . 
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to . 
The debates we are having these days , on a certain European country ' s government , for example , show , do they not , that we must place the spiritual , moral , constitutional , community and common welfare - orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing , and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason , as this will be a crucial stabilising factor . 
I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights . 
The European Union needs few , if any , new instruments , and it does not need any new competences . 
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice . 
For this reason , we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out , on behalf of the citizens , the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty . 
In my view , that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on . 
If we succeed in making progress here , then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union . 
This is the crux of the matter . 
Mr President - in - Office of the Council , I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage . 
 , chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .  ( IT ) Mr President - in - Office , on listening to the various interventions , you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament ' s political groups , the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency , instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference . 
I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this , last week in the Committee I chair , but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager . 
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries , and therefore in their parliaments . 
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments , which were represented by competent and exacting delegations . 
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging . 
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union ' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table . 
However , we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference . 
Yesterday , we also discussed the Commission , represented by Commissioner Barnier , who gave its opinion . This effort was appreciated , even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals , and moreover , Mr President - in - Office , you also expressed different views . 
Nevertheless , we must stress that many people are aware , as they were yesterday too , of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe , a risk that was , moreover , indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one ' s attention , owing to the authority of the person being interviewed - Jacques Delors . 
We must , therefore , ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the Union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the House even today , with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of principles , values and rights underpinning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union , with regard , among other things , to running the economy . 
We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency , we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference . 
Mr President , only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement . 
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction . 
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and , hence , a widened IGC agenda . 
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and , unfortunately , turned a deaf ear to this Parliament . 
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor ' s book . 
It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC . 
In many ways , they share the same interests and the same insights . 
An essential component of this joint effort should , in any case , be this Parliament ' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty . 
Of all priorities , this one is the most pressing . 
What is the Commission ' s verdict on this ? 
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and , therefore , not only within the working party , but also at the same political level as the Commission . 
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission . 
Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States , but we owe them to ourselves . 
If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement , we will drown in our own political quagmire . 
Mr President , there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament . It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self - mutilation . 
After having restricted , on its own initiative , its participation in the IGC to two minor seats , Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC . The fact is , whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way , you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion , Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it , i . e . demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion . 
Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow , 3 February , as a matter of urgency , when we could wait , in a position of strength , until the opening of the Strasbourg part - session on 14 February , and thus force an agenda that is complete , and therefore consistent , on the Council . 
A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today . Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly , in our resolution , that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues , since in our haste , with blameworthy naivety , we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda . 
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC , then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this . 
Whether we want it or not , since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates , the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union . 
I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority , those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers , to take up their pilgrims ' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended , since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council . 
Because of the situation in Austria , this is a dark day for Europe . 
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive , and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing . 
In order to assert our fundamental values , they need to be laid down in writing , as a matter of urgency , and , beyond this IGC , I believe we owe Europe a constitution . 
Mr President , the draft resolution we are now discussing requires , precisely as before , that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions . 
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this . 
I am convinced that this is an error of judgement . 
A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement . 
A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries . 
Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level . 
It is not , however , possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union . 
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank . This is untenable . 
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic , the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered . 
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity . 
Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible . 
The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re - examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective . 
Article 56 of the Treaty , prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital , must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control . 
In the majority of EU countries , there are now governments dominated by social democrats . 
It is remarkable that , now they have the opportunity to do so , none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union . 
It also , of course , damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital . 
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference . 
It is , however , important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States . 
It is the Member States ' parliaments , or people voting in referenda , who are to direct the development of the Treaty . 
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification . 
Mr President , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text , which I shall vote for , even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it . 
Nevertheless , the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right . 
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values , whether it comes down to an economic free trade area , or whether , on the other hand , it has a greater ambition : the desire to be a supranational union , in ways that have yet to be defined , that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world . 
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution . 
The amendment of the Treaties was , however , limited to a review of some internal rules , which was necessary and important , but did not answer the fundamental question : what is Europe , what are its common principles and therefore , its objectives and limitations ? 
However , politics exacts its revenge , and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda , it comes back in , as a matter of fact , through a door , and through the front door in the case of Austria , since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance , xenophobia and forms of racism . 
And it is not a question of links with the past ; it is a question of prospects for the future , and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this . 
I belong to a world , the world of Liberal Catholics , which is not left - wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values , and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values . 
The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights , in a European Constitution , then we shall construct a Europe without a solid , lasting base . 
Commissioner Barnier , I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values : make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles , because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe . 
Mr President , I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which , looked long and hard at , threatens the whole of democratic Europe . 
I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU . 
They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles . 
I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country , Denmark , takes it for granted that , when we enlarge the circle of EU countries to include the envisaged huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union , we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth , that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe . 
However , that is precisely what is happening . 
With every single geographical extension to the area covered by the EU , we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth , and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is contemplating , especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth . 
In the light of developments in recent days , it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State entailing intervention in that Member State ' s democratic process . 
You can think what you like about Mr Haider , and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician , but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country ' s democratic process . 
When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty , we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time , sometimes in contravention of the Treaty , as we have just seen . 
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon . 
On 14 February , we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000 . 
This is a big task but it can be done . 
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement . 
In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important " Amsterdam leftovers "  . 
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re - weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe . 
In relation to the latter point , Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining . 
We are prepared to consider re - weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers , provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission . 
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point . 
At the IGC , we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution . 
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re - negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty . 
In other words , if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions . 
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully . 
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents . 
The Treaty of Amsterdam , Mr President , has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe . 
Mr President , I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos / Leinen resolution , which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible . 
In any case , this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon . 
I think that , under the present rules of the Treaties , the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation . 
On the contrary , we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms , in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note . 
We must use dialogue at every political level , including of course dialogue with the national parliaments . 
That way , we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms . 
Parliament ' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that , with the Union ' s institutional changes , we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union . 
They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone . 
The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive . 
It may be easy to come up with solutions , but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term . 
I will mention two point that may create tension . 
One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries . 
Europe is not , nor can it become a classic federal state . 
The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union , which is a union of states and peoples . 
The other area of conflict is more difficult . 
Owing to the imminent increase in membership , the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective . 
This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly . 
By its very nature , however , the European Union is , and will remain , a complex and convoluted multi - governmental institution . 
Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist . Of course they do , but they are not unlimited . 
If the limits are exceeded because of a one - sided quest for effectiveness , then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer . 
I am , however , optimistic . 
Mr President , the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened . 
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union . 
It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union , which will , however , be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned . 
The Commission ' s former president , Jacques Delors , has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation . He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions , for the sake of clarity . 
The Commission ' s current President , Mr Prodi , and the High Representative , Mr Solana , have put forward ideas along the same lines . 
Last November , the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe : the onion skin model . 
In the next resolution on the IGC , Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility . 
Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings , as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party . 
My colleagues , Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken , somewhat sceptically , about some aspects of the matter in hand . 
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity , not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self - governing regions . 
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about . 
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament . 
A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly . 
If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality , six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants , you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367 , 000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales , which is a partly self - governing region of the United Kingdom . 
Scotland , with a population of 5 million , has eight seats in this House at the moment ; Denmark and Finland , with the same population , have sixteen . 
Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700 , bring in 26 % more population over time , and then adopt the Commission ' s , I think ill - considered , proposition , that there should be a European list of candidates . 
What will happen to a place like Scotland , which I represent here ? 
It will become totally invisible ! 
Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions , people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones . 
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view . 
Mr President , to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new . 
It has been said many times . 
This time , however , it is true . We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement . 
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not . 
Will we enlarge with or without deep reform ? 
That is the debate , and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference , its agenda or its method . 
It is clear that the Council , for the moment , has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place . 
That puts enlargement in danger . 
It jeopardises any prospect of political union and , of course , it is difficult for the public to understand . 
The Council must realise that , if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations , the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further . 
The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion . 
We want an Intergovernmental Conference , but not this one . 
Must there be an IGC ? 
Of course there must , but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference . 
The agenda must go much further . 
We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic . 
Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes , more - its ability to take the initiative . 
We must clearly set firm objectives . 
The functionalist approach is over , for better or for worse . 
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point . 
Have we achieved results ? 
Yes , but the point is to make a qualitative leap and , speaking in political terms , this , Mr President - in - Office of the Council , means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen of the House , at this stage , following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest , I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work , your two rapporteurs , Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen , proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus , if this opinion were adopted , the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February , as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency . 
As far as we are concerned , after producing the opinion expected from the Commission , according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty , we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated . 
We know , I know myself , that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us . 
I would just like to make a few comments , after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups . 
Firstly , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda . 
I understand this anxiety , this fear that the agenda may be too limited , and yet I feel , as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki , that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate . 
Indeed , it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate , which the Commission framed for its own opinion , but using all the terms thereof , plus everything between the lines . 
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so - called leftovers , which is , in any case , an incorrect label . 
I do not like the term ' leftovers ' any more than Richard Corbett does . 
It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects , and difficult , so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth . 
As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects , even though I do consider them as priorities , and consider that they must be dealt with now . 
They are the first but they are not the only subjects , Mr Seguro , that the conference must deal with . 
We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference , if the Portuguese Presidency firstly , and then the French Presidency , so wish , in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement . 
We are ready for it , whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , on which work has started , the CFSP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations , or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work : reorganisation of the Treaties . 
I have heard many comments on the Commission ' s opinion , which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth , with specific indications of new draft articles , but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate . 
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate , by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers . 
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings , I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me , on the basis of our shared experience , in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives , Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok , are going to be working . 
Of course , the final trade - offs will be made , as in any institutional negotiations , and I think this is no bad thing , at Council level , especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government , who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands . 
Let me point out , in passing , that the Commission President , Mr Prodi , is also a Council member , and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role , alongside the Heads of State and Government , particularly during the final period . 
However , these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared . 
This preparatory work , this fine - tuning , must not be omitted , ladies and gentlemen of the House . I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful , and that it will not just be limited to technical details . 
I think that all of us , the personal representatives of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs , your two representatives , and myself , as a representative of the Commission , will be going into matters in detail , but it will be afterwards , at a different level , one in which we will also be participating , that the last trade - offs must be made . 
Throughout this conference , ladies and gentlemen , it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important , but the quality of what they will be saying . 
And once again I should like to point out in this House , in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam , that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament , prior to Amsterdam , the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations . 
I am sure that the situation will be just the same and , as far as I am concerned , in my current position , I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations . 
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be . 
We now await , therefore , with great interest , ladies and gentlemen of the House , your next opinion , in which you will specify Parliament ' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations . 
It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations , the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other , alongside the Council members , explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually , every day , what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest . 
In the coming months , ladies and gentlemen of the House , the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation , on good terms , with your two representatives , Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok , in order to reconcile our points of view , if need be . 
Quite probably , our points of view and our positions will not always be the same . 
There will probably be differences of opinion , that would be only normal . 
The important thing is that we are consistent , and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner . 
Our concern and our ambition , therefore , on a large number of subjects , is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully . 
This will not be a matter of chance , since , let me repeat , I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union . 
Finally , I should like to make three additional comments , quite briefly , Mr President . 
Firstly , to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano , the chairman , and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate . 
Such dialogue between the national parliaments , the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important . 
I have said , furthermore , that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments . 
Tomorrow , I shall be in London . In a fortnight ' s time , I shall be in Berlin . 
In three weeks ' time , I shall be in Paris , and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another . 
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive , and I should like to thank you for taking it . 
My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency , particularly Mr Seixas da Costa , for his proactive approach . Indeed , the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own : the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency . 
It will have to initiate these negotiations . 
We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency , in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000 . Not only that a conclusion can be reached , but that a successful conclusion can be reached , which is not necessarily the same thing . 
Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully . 
The handover will have been made , but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made , by yourself , Mr President , and by the Portuguese Presidency , are going to be extremely important , as is the nature of this handover . 
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together , under your guidance particularly , in the course of these few months , which is extremely important . 
We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency ' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion , and indeed great expectations thereof . Portugal is a small country , but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions . 
After having heard Prime Minister Guterres , the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself , I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations . 
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months . 
Finally , let me repeat , we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations . 
These are difficult subjects , subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain . 
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament , Ministers , Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens , to public debate . 
As far as the Commission is concerned , it will , ladies and gentlemen , be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate . 
Cross - border services
 -  ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today , but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do . 
I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative , and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today . 
It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third - country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self - employed basis . 
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees , I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst . 
These have , in fact , clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third - country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross - border services and this without having to obtain work permits . 
However , the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue . 
Furthermore , not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice ' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement , and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross - border services ; barriers that are often impossible to overcome , especially for the smaller companies . 
The situation as far as self - employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third - country nationals the right to provide cross - border services . 
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here . 
Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises . 
It is not about establishing original rights for third - country nationals modelled on freedom of movement . 
All provisions , i . e . issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights , should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services . 
I , together with the European Parliament ' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view , as expressed in the report produced by the Council ' s Legal Service , is inappropriate . 
Consequently , I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council ' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned . 
I also believe that Parliament ' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission ' s proposal . 
Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council , and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense . 
When it comes to acceptance by the Council , I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible , even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals . 
I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis . 
Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments , one of the essential differences is that , in place of a " service provision card plus notification for each individual contract " system , provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract . 
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms . 
However , in order to compensate for this , all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued , and as the Commission ' s proposal would have it , more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued . 
An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection , not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter . 
This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self - employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident . 
Likewise , the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued , namely under the terms of an opposition procedure . 
What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States , rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States . 
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs . 
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months , and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting . 
However , we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months . 
When it comes to self - employed persons , in addition to the amendments already described , we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent , and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self - employment . 
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . 
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee ' s amendments , which they adopted unanimously . 
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions . 
I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament ' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted ; whether or not one should use the number or date alone , or both , and how extensively to quote from them . 
Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report . 
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self - employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons . 
I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology , i . e . the correct way to quote . 
This would make our rapporteur ' s life considerably easier in the future . 
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio ' s reports . 
Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously , and I would like to stand by this outcome , which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions . 
On a final note , I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports , which were far from easy to produce . 
I would like to single Mr Wieland out for special mention , for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report , contributing excellent and constructive ideas ; and this without being in a position to receive the plaudits awarded a rapporteur . 
That is why he deserves special mention ! 
 . 
 ( NL ) Mr President , I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger ' s speech , after which I will , of course , listen with all due attention to the next speakers . 
If you allow me , Mr President , I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate . 
May I say how the Commission welcomes the European Parliament ' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third - country employees , the topic of the debate . 
I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge . 
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . 
The Commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards . 
If the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more , or all , Member States , the procedure would be more flexible still . 
The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card . 
However , I do not consider a three - month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State . 
The Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice . 
An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross - border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market . 
It seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards . 
Indeed , it should be possible for a third - country subject who has legal status in a Member State to be admitted to other Member States too . 
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public - order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification . 
Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has expired . 
Following completion of the service , it is not acceptable for the third - country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided . 
That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio ' s Amendment No 22 in both respects . 
As far as the second proposal is concerned , the Commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self - employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal . 
These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments . 
I hope that , at the end of the debate , when all the speakers have contributed , I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments . 
Mr President , tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as well as the amended version . 
I propose to confine my comments to two areas . 
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve , that is achieve in the real sense . 
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account . 
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment . 
Then there are the interests of the Member States , which , being on the receiving end , may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario . 
If we are going to abide by the one extreme , that is the interests of the Member States , then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high . 
There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card . 
If I were to go to the other extreme , as few hurdles as possible that is , then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive . 
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place , but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high , in reality no one would apply for the card . 
Alternatively , I might have no directive at all . 
Neither outcome would be satisfactory . 
Perhaps this is also why , as is rumoured to be the case , the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well . 
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of finding the easiest possible solution . 
We want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis - à - vis the business world , but once these have been overcome , implementation is as easy as it possibly could be . 
Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States . 
If a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis , and only in Denmark , then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark . 
Accordingly , the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance . 
In return for this , however , we want early notification obligations to be discontinued , rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them , and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his / her posting . 
Consequently , I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . 
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission . 
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution . 
If a particular Member State was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country , then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card , as it were , for the reasons cited in this directive , which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution . 
Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter . 
Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers . 
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty , some of them very old , which are still referred to as EC . 
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law . 
However , before the elections we - the Council , the Commission , Parliament , the press , unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens . 
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU . 
They have now got to grips with " EU "  . 
We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver " EC service provision card " and not " EU service provision card "  . 
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in , this is the one that counts in their eyes . 
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction . 
Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed . 
One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism . 
This directive is , of course , not in itself directly about that . 
It is about attending to the needs of the internal market , creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self - employed . 
That is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger . 
We welcome that , and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision , we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law . 
Mr President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally , which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive , which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council . 
Nevertheless , I have tabled an amendment . 
Mrs Berger , in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6 , you mention legal security . 
The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit , since all that does is create legal insecurity . 
You rightly raise the concern , also expressed by Mr Wieland , at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire , but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit . 
If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date , it must end on that date . 
Legal security requires this . 
On the other hand , with regard to point d of Amendment No 10 , which refers to the first directive , you suggest that , for reasons of public security or public order regulations , a Member State may reject the validity of the card . 
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive . 
It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area , since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State , and the second Member State would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory . 
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity . 
In the case of a non - Schengen state , in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22 , that possibility is contemplated , and is perfectly expressed , and I believe this provides greater legal security . 
The discretional power of the State , which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10 , seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report . 
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully , and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result . 
On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks . 
However , in the case of the United Kingdom , we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable . 
Partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom . 
Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties , the United Kingdom retains its border controls . 
Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation , third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described , will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State , thereby by - passing UK border controls . 
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements , that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process . 
For that reason , we shall vote against both these proposals . 
Mr President , Commissioner , first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner . 
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services . 
The new regulation for cross - border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises . 
The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr Wieland on this - are essential , for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts . 
Why do I think we need the directive so much ? 
Three reasons and they are as follows : on account of the economic importance of third - country workers in the EU , in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market . 
Therefore , whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions , I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible . 
My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission . Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations ? 
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view , as this will have important implications , notably for the accession negotiations and for our country , which shares common borders with so many applicant countries ? 
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms , namely the free movement of people and services , did not apply to them . 
Indeed , they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided . 
There are approximately thirteen million third - country subjects who reside within European territory . 
I assume that , although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known , their number will most definitely not be low . 
So , up to now , their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation . 
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card . 
It seems important , in this respect , to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner , namely within five days of a simple declaration ' s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided ; and that , also to prevent misuse , this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended . 
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner . 
Having also studied the amendments submitted , I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow . 
May I , to finish off , thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having , in that way , added an important degree of meaning to her report ? 
I think that , with this report , we are , once again , one step closer to the realisation of the internal market . 
Mr President , thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail . 
In the course of my speech , I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regarding the remark he has just made . 
Regarding the first proposal on third - country employees , the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 and 22 . 
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too , provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established . 
The Commission also agrees with Amendment No 11 , except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months , as I explained just now . 
We also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as , as a result of this , the card ' s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States . 
In terms of comitology , Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part , insofar as the rights of Parliament are concerned . 
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three - month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned . 
In this respect , the Commission supports Amendment No 22 , as I have already mentioned . The other amendments are unacceptable . 
Personally , I am rather in favour of the term " EU service provision card " which is proposed in Amendment No 1 , but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this . 
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96 / 71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force , no change is necessary . 
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued . 
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States . 
Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable , given my thoughts on Amendment No 10 . 
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal . 
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable . 
As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term " self - employed " is concerned , the Commission will , as I have already remarked , provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged . 
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood ' s remark . 
He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States , and this includes the United Kingdom , are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders . 
This applies , as already stated , to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium , where it was recently of relevance . 
With regard to the remark made by Mr Karas , I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country . 
The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non - EU countries . 
The question is , furthermore , one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way . 
In my opinion , this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate . 
On behalf of the Commission , I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point . 
I will keep myself free in this connection . 
Finally , I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and , in particular , of course , the rapporteur , Mrs Berger . 
Thank you very much , Commissioner Bolkestein . 
The debate is closed . 
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . 00 a . m . 
Court of First Instance
Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report , which , on reading it , gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council ' s draft decision . 
However , this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results , such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency ' s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation , composition and competences of the Community Courts . 
For this reason , I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice - President Marinho . 
Mr President , the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if , in the future , we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales , and if , in the future , the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon . 
Today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market , and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests . 
Behind these principles , Mr President , lies the justice system . 
However , justice delayed is justice denied , and we must reflect on this notion . 
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information . 
For this reason , the draft reform , which has been drawn up by the rapporteur , Vice - President Marinho , is to be welcomed . 
It is true that it is a stopgap solution , but we must rely on stopgap solutions because , at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference . 
We have to offer solutions which , while provisional , help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice . 
I would like to make two observations during this intervention , which stem from the report itself , given this Parliament ' s obligation , in accordance with the Treaty , to produce a very succinct report , which does not go into depth . 
These are two of Vice - President Marinho ' s ideas and , I believe , they are seconded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . 
The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance , and that they should be given one more référendaire . 
The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated . 
At the moment , the Court of First Instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated . 
According to the Treaty , one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language . 
Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference , let us consider just two points . 
The first concerns this Parliament . 
I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice , even in the appointment of judges . 
Above all , we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice , hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations , in other words , its resources . 
We wish to see its competences extended , especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible options , certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens . 
And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days . 
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report . 
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency . 
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice . 
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT . 
The decision could have huge implications for our local economy . 
Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age . 
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe ' s system of justice . 
Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy . 
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect , but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court . 
Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references . 
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff , rather of the Court ' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union . 
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative , but Europe is a legal construction , its courts are central to its proper functioning . 
In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system . 
Otherwise we will all , as elected representatives , be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice . 
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report . 
I also fully endorse his findings , in which , in particular , he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service . 
In point of fact , I consider this to be necessary because we heard , following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market ' s visit to Luxembourg , that it is of course inevitable , a God - given fact as it were , that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service , and so more often than not , important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve . 
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here . 
For example , I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance , if applicable , and making this a final competence , in those spheres where benches of the Court , which resemble courts , pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law . 
I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission ' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level . 
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought , as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions . 
We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind . 
Where possible , one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance . 
In addition , we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs , not to mention groups , lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases , when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance . 
On a final note , I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law . 
As things stand , OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases . 
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court . 
The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance . 
That would be another way of spurring the reform process on . 
Mr President , I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work . 
The European Union is a system based on law . 
It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law . 
Furthermore , if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them , what happens , as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out , is that justice delayed becomes , as we know , justice denied . 
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem . 
However , as Mr Marinho has pointed out , more is necessary , but that has to wait for the IGC , 
In my own country , mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges . 
There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system . 
The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo / French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union ' s disputes resolution procedures . 
This has been compounded , so some who advise me believe , by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non - French nationals to proceed against the French Government . 
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible . 
This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable . 
What is happening in France , Mr President , appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties . 
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner , who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate , to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings . 
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this . 
Mr President , on behalf of Commission President , Mr Prodi , I would like to respond as follows . 
The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance . The purport of this request is , on the one hand , to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance , such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and , on the other hand , to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance . 
May I add that , on behalf of the Commission , I listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas . 
The unease is justified . 
It has been said more than once : justice delayed is justice denied . 
The Commission sympathises with these considerations . In the light of this sympathy , I would like to continue my response as follows . 
As your Parliament is aware , the Commission is convinced that , without fundamental reform , the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines . 
Consequently , the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades . 
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judges , but at the moment , the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned . 
In other words , once this study is complete , the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible . 
Thank you , Commissioner . 
The debate is closed . 
The vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow . 
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo
The next item is the report ( A5 - 0022 / 2000 ) by Mr Brok , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo ( COM ( 99 ) 0598 - C5 - 0045 / 00 - 1999 / 0240 ( CNS ) ) . 
I have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes . 
I propose that we start the debate immediately . 
He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives . 
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges , in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets . 
Mr President , this is an important and urgent matter , and Parliament is complying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly , because today , you must realise , men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero , these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid . 
An urgent request has been referred to us , and we approve it . 
We have been asked for EUR 35 million . 
We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring , once the decision has been taken , that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible . We are talking about macrofinancial aid . 
There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration . 
This is not our opinion . 
Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region . 
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state . 
The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments , the donors have made commitments and , obviously , we are the only ones actually paying . 
The other parties are not paying . 
We wish to see an end to this one - sided situation regarding requests for financial aid . 
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this . 
We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors . 
This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but , quite the contrary , to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors . 
From that point of view , the proposed facility is a two - phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest . 
Finally , we have three questions for the Commission in this regard . Firstly , we need the Commission to give us , on a regular basis , the list and the amounts that other donors contribute . 
When we come to pay , we want to know what the others are paying . 
Secondly , we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation . 
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet , according to our information , no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date . 
This is serious , since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo . 
Finally , and this follows on from what I have just said , we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis , monthly , regarding progress on payments made . 
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments . 
It is not firm commitments that we need , just plain commitments would suffice , and we need to know what has actually been paid and , more especially , what has not been paid . 
Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment . 
Mr President , if we are going to discuss Kosovo today , as we have done many times before , then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo , or of whether in fact anything has been done at all . 
What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality , and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate . 
As of 9 February , there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council , which will comprise representatives of the political parties , the minorities and civil society , and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament . 
This is a positive move and we welcome it , but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare , for elections are planned for the autumn . 
No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result . 
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis - à - vis UNMIK . 
In other words , there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either . 
Of all people , it is the Albanians , who are now being integrated into the transitional council , who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them . 
In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work , urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs , Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country , so that at some point in the near future , on the road to coexistence , it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place . 
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about . 
Administration - wise there are now 34 tax inspectors . 
That is excellent news ! 
There too , people are being encouraged to pay their taxes , for it will not do in the long - term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors ; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources . 
It should also be noted that of the 19 departments , 4 already have administrative leadership , which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto . 
There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law . 
We have 130 judges and public prosecutors , who have now been sworn in , and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice , with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little , and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions . 
Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country . 
I believe that is a good thing
I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way . 
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything . 
It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar , but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner ' s outstanding bills . 
One could do so once or twice , but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well , for there is a very large hole , as yet unfilled , that we are unable to fill . 
We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it . 
Mr President , I would like to offer a few explanations . 
In a debate , there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said . 
However , I would like to concentrate on two points . 
Firstly , I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo . 
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true , and that figures do not lie . 
Let us make this clear , however much some people may not wish to believe it . 
The Union has decided to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo , on the basis of an IMF report which estimates that a further EUR 115 million is needed for that reconstruction . 
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments . 
I would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter , in any circumstances , the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin . 
This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached , with great difficulty , with the Council in December , according to which , when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction , the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary . 
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach . 
I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme , with the corresponding report , requested by Parliament , so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up , as we have been promised . 
Lastly , I would like to insist that , although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now , we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough , and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo , which is so badly needed . 
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , please excuse my late arrival , but this other political issue is still on the agenda today , more is the pity . 
The Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million , and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need . 
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there . 
However , this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process . 
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents . 
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions . 
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future . 
It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this . 
However , we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here . 
One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims . In other words , we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner ' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres . 
Secondly , even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there , we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into . 
This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations . 
It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe , in the interests of the persons affected . 
This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms , that is to say , not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south - east Europe , and with the aid delivered there . 
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence . 
We have so many coordinators , who , in turn , are responsible to so many employers , that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators . 
Perhaps it would be better , however , if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations , were to get together some time to introduce a uniform , coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there . 
I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this , but if the European Union is doing the most work out there , then it should also be given the leadership , and bring coherence to the situation , so that we can be of real assistance to the people . 
It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground ! 
Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline , that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented , and there is a steady stream of new press conferences , this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe ! 
Accordingly , we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative , so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month . Rather , we must use this initiative to establish a long - term aid strategy for this country , and I hope that in the process , you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months . 
Mr President , when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo its objective was to re - establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return , with respect for their own heritage and their own culture . 
If the Alliance is still active in that region , it is with the same objective . 
The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an interview given by the KFOR commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were starting to be , particularly as regards security , crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level . 
Those representing Europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective , and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary - General of the United Nations , are on the verge of despondency precisely because , since matters are improving , there is less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent . 
We must work to ensure that , in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally , the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords . 
It is true that economic aid is , in this respect , certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level . 
Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we , the Members of the European Parliament , must fulfil our own obligations in this regard , while ensuring , of course , that we are not the only ones to do so . 
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Brok , for his report . 
If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on . 
The Council ' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret . 
The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should , and must , provide help swiftly , however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random . 
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point , which clearly emphasises that it is only possible , and permissible , to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi - public , communal and other authorities and institutions , which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK . 
Commissioner , it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations , in particular Pillar 4 of course , and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place . 
What is to be done with this money ? 
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights . 
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today ? 
We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen : people are killed , people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit . 
Every single day there are attacks on Serbs , on the Roma , on Bosnians , but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians . 
I was in fact shocked to read in the report , assuming this is true , how an Albanian doctor , who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties , ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life . 
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated . 
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo . 
There are , at the very least , rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again . 
It is irrelevant , as far as I am concerned , as to whether it is Serbs , Roma , Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo . 
It is also irrelevant , in my view , as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo . 
What is all - important , to my mind , is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve , a multi - ethnic Kosovo that is , a Kosovo where people can live together . 
We need more police officers , as we have nowhere near enough . 
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish - , we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights . 
All of this needs to happen , and quickly too . 
If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise . 
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly , to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available . 
Only , now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo , and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use , notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary . 
 . 
 ( ES ) Mr President , I would like firstly to thank the Members , and especially the rapporteur , for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue . 
This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned . 
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight ' s debate . 
Firstly , although much progress has been made , and we could mention customs administration , bank administration or tax administration , it is true that we must continue to move forward . 
However , in moving forward , what should we be financing ? 
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement . 
In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds , for example , Amendments Nos 3 and 5 . 
In our view , however , in both respects , greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which , on the ground , is more aware of the reality than we are . 
We believe that to prejudge , at the moment , where resources should be directed , would create more practical difficulties . 
In short , we should put our faith in those parties who , in these areas , are better equipped than us to make certain decisions . 
The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges , but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors . 
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate ? 
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question . 
For example , Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 4 . 
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue , that this is not the fundamental problem , although we recognise it totally . 
The fundamental problem is that , at the moment , the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Steering Group , but it is also true that they have no legal status . This is simply a political commitment . 
That is the reason why , while accepting its spirit , we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources . 
I would say the same about Amendment No 2 , which we would also accept with a slight modification , since the idea seems to us to be basically correct . 
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature . On this specific point , we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction . 
We have already spoken to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision , establishing this element of conditionality . 
With regard to the second contribution , what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors . 
In other words , we should not establish conditionality , or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start , but , nevertheless , we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage . 
In this way , we would have no problem in acting immediately . We would not create problems for the Kosovar people , but , on the other hand , we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing . 
A third problem has been raised by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes . 
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual . 
The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account . 
Lastly , I would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us . 
On the one hand , we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and , in this respect , I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament ' s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo . 
The Commission can commit itself to regularly informing Parliament of the invitations to tender which are published . 
We also wish to see these publicised on the Internet , so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point . 
A second point which I would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance . 
In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed , on a confidential basis , if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality , on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance . 
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen , and I hope that , with the final decision of the Council , we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties , so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see . 
Mr President , I am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between Parliament , particularly the Committee on Budgets , and the Commission , and we can assure you that , for our part , we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of its duties . 
I do , however , have one small concern , when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets . 
There was a clear agreement , good or bad I will not say , but there was a contract . There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7 , i . e . on the idea of linking the mobilisation , the implementation , of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment . 
But , if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly , then this undertaking was only a tentative one . 
Commissioner , an agreement is an agreement . 
Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets , yes or no ? Or are you going to drop this proviso , thus breaking the undertaking made to us ? 
No , Mr Bourlanges , I think it is a substantive problem . 
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted . 
What I proposed to you , and what I still say , is that the Commission will make a statement , in the Council Decision , something like this : 
The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo ' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors . 
With this , we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed . 
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche . 
I agree , absolutely . We shall do so . 
The debate is closed . 
The vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow . 
ALTENER
The next item is the report ( A5 - 0011 / 2000 ) by Mr Langen , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener ( C5 - 0333 / 1999 - 1997 / 0370 ( COD ) ) 
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council . 
The project has been long and problematic . 
In future too , there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources . 
Although there is much that is good about the new directive , it is nonetheless not without its defects . 
One example is the use of peat . 
Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels . 
If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable , non - fossil energy source , it must form its own class , especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned . 
It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as , for example , coal . 
The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union ' s dependence on imported energy . 
Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU ' s next round of enlargement . 
Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries , whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy . 
The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate . 
We are all concerned about the environment and our children ' s future . 
The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased , but it has to be done in a rational manner . 
We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come . 
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate : nuclear energy . 
Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme . 
Firstly , however , I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Langen , for the truly excellent work he has done on this report . 
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee , Mr Provan . 
For as Mr Langen said just now , we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee . 
However , we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout . 
Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament ' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point , that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community . 
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear . 
However , we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed . 
For in the course of the next few years , the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double , accounting for at least 12 % of energy consumption . 
This is the European Union ' s declared aim . 
That being the case , since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources , it will certainly be have a key role . 
In the first place , this new five - year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme . 
This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector , developing local and regional energy agencies , and establishing new networks for approving financial support , to name but a few examples . 
To my mind though , what is particularly important about the ALTENER II programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing , supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan . 
We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission ' s services on a breakthrough campaign , which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy . 
It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors . 
It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it . 
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion . 
75 % - 80 % of this is to come from private sources , and this will be supplemented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions . 
In this respect , the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment , and help us to realise our ambition , in the interests of environmental protection , the economy and creating new jobs . 
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent work in this important matter . 
The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee is , after all the difficult phases it has been through , at least satisfactory . 
Most of Parliament ' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive . 
The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy . 
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets , however . 
The appropriations are needed for pilot projects , research , information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy . 
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States . 
This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy . 
However , in the future , the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market . 
Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment . 
The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up . 
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness . 
Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy . 
We should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment . 
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat ? 
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources . 
However , it is important , at least in Finland , as a sustainably used , slowly renewable energy source . 
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables . 
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance are pleased with the agreement which has been found , and their thanks go to all those who negotiated so well in favour of an amendment which the Greens were almost the authors of . 
It is interesting for me , as a new Member of Parliament , to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation . 
This is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale . 
In contrast with that , I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies , which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion . 
Seeing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field , because they were the first ones to develop that area , gives one food for thought , I feel , and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies . 
One last word regarding the programme . I think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there . 
In order to ensure that at least 50 % of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources , it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term . 
Mr President , may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work . 
The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future . 
For this reason , I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium - sized enterprises . 
The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone . In this regard , it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit . 
It is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables . 
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend £ 125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector . 
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives . 
As the final text rightly states , actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities . 
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster , a significant portion of which falls within Ireland ' s only Objective I region . 
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions , including the energy sector . 
In short , we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol , while at the same time promoting growth in our economies . 
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States . 
Mr President , Mr Langen , ladies and gentlemen , as our rapporteur mentioned , we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme . 
Mr Langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initially FF 74 million , whereas the Commission proposed 81 . 1 million , a figure which the European Parliament supported . 
An initial conciliation meeting was not successful , because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1 . 9 million . 
We could not agree with a proposal like this , which challenged the authority of the European Parliament . 
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1 . 1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million . 
In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal , personally , once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply , job creation and environmental protection , challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to . 
In fact , renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives . 
However , in spite of the reservations I am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation , I personally support the compromise , by virtue of the programme ' s content , to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as , following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty , this sector become subject to codecision . 
It is practically certain that , with the raft of proposed measures and actions , it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12 % renewable energy share by 2010 , doubling the current rate , as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available . 
This programme , together with the SAVE II programme , integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy , establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence . 
And , in conclusion , Mr President , let me also insist upon the fact that , in addition to the measures proposed , there are also legislative measures and , most especially , adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives . 
And I shall end , of course , by congratulating Mr Langen , our rapporteur , on his work , as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee . 
 . 
 ( ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the ALTENER II programme in the Conciliation Committee and associate myself with the comments of the different speakers and , of course , point out that this agreement will allow the ALTENER programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme . 
All of this will provide greater coordination , transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes , into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme , which we will be discussing soon . 
I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality , and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary . 
Obviously , there have been arguments , we had to go to conciliation , as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago , since at the first meeting no result was achieved , and there had to be a second meeting , despite the fact that the figures were not excessive . 
However , I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement , which , like all agreements , is perhaps not perfect , but which , I believe , allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing . 
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Langen , on his work , to thank the speakers and , of course , to acknowledge the actions of Vice - President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure , who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result . 
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council . 
SAVE
The next item is the report ( A5 - 0010 / 2000 ) by Mrs Ahern , on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE ( C5 - 0334 / 1999 - 1997 / 0371 ( COD ) ) . 
Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good - tempered all round , which is not always the case . 
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re - worded form . 
The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council ' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there . 
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading . 
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments , including a re - instatement of the Commission ' s original budget . 
The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable . 
During the procedure , agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise , implement , complement and assess the Community measures . 
Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non - legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and , very importantly , the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency . 
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress . 
The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council ' s very meagre opening offer . 
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount . 
We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under . 
This was an important consideration for us . 
I would like to say however that it is , and has always been , a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real . 
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States . 
We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme . 
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level , this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action , including Community actions , on energy saving . 
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re - invent the wheel in every region . 
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard . 
SAVE is the only Community - wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy . 
It focuses on non - technical elements , helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure , and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted . 
Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings . 
We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business , saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non - problematical . 
It is something that we can all support . 
I have to say , like motherhood , although we all support it , sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy - saving . 
We could do rather more , considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports . 
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see . 
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change . 
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do . 
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process . 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal , since she has contributed , in collaboration with the other Members , to the achievement of a very reasonable final result , which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and , of course , on what , from a budgetary point of view , the Council had initially accepted . 
As Mrs Ahern has explained very well , the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme , are basically symbolic budgets , since the burden is shouldered by the countries , the States of the Union , the regions or even , in some cases , the local authorities . 
However , despite the fact that the volume is relatively small , it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action , which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments . This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources , greater safety in our energy supplies and , in the case of SAVE , to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy , thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set . 
Furthermore , behind these programmes , that is to say , the SAVE programme , which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings , and the Altener programme , which concerns renewable energy , there lies an extremely important technological challenge , which , from an economic point of view , may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole . 
With regard to the parliamentary procedure , I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken , especially the rapporteur , because the majority of Parliament ' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council , in this case practically all of them , although with some modifications . I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved . 
This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds , as we said at the time , and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament ' s prerogatives and competences . 
From the point of view of the Commission , in this interinstitutional game , I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it . 
I would like once again to thank all the speakers , and also , especially , the Vice - President , Mr Provan , for his magnificent work throughout this debate , particularly during the conciliation procedure , as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and , also , above all , the rapporteur , Mrs Ahern , and all the Members who have participated in this work . 
Thank you , Commissioner . 
The debate is closed . 
The vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow . 
CULTURE 2000
The next item is the report ( A5 - 0009 / 2000 ) by Mr Graça Moura , on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ( ' Culture 2000 ' )  ( C5 - 0327 / 1999 - 1998 / 0169 ( COD ) ) . 
Madam President , I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate . 
Unfortunately , there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it . 
We have the feeling , and are in fact convinced , that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht . 
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture . 
Sadly that is the case and we must face facts . 
I would like to thank the rapporteur , who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task , in conjunction with the Commissioner of course . 
We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content , of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect . 
One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind , where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision . 
What kind of horse - trading system is this ? Certainly not a fair one ! 
There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side , begging for a little more money for culture . 
It is downright scandalous what goes on ! 
It is an awful sort of horse - trading , based on unequal positions ! 
Nevertheless , we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to . 
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us . 
We will support small and medium - sized events , not the large ones , and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access . I believe that the fact that Culture and , fittingly , Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner ' s remit , will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes , which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union . 
If one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied , but then only a tiny bit . 
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money . 
Madam President , I agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and I must add that , during the conciliation procedure , I was personally a little disappointed with the Council . 
On the one hand , it continued to refuse to accept the term " European cultural policy " or other similar terms , even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty , and it defines " Culture 2000 " simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more . 
On the other hand , it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament , which were minimal anyway . 
Incidentally , this last point would be unfair to fourteen Members of the Council , since it was just one , the Netherlands , which was responsible for that intransigence . 
It has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council . 
This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution . 
However , Madam President , these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow , and which the Socialists will vote in favour of , will put in place one of the European Union ' s most important programmes . 
By taking action in the field of culture , we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul , especially given the fact that the sub - programmes which make up " Culture 2000 " are superb . 
In recent years , these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the youngest and most dynamic citizens of the European Union . 
Lastly , I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have formed of the rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura : his knowledge , his sense of balance , his intellectual qualities , make him , in my opinion , the best possible rapporteur this report could have had . 
Congratulations ! 
Finally , I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding , Vice - President Imbeni and Mr Gargani , chairman of the Committee on Culture , for the firm and intelligent position which , each within his own role , they have maintained during the entire conciliation process . 
Madam President , Commissioner , rapporteur , I would like to start by thanking Mr Graça Moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme . 
It has been said before , and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions , that culture is , of course , extremely important as an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the European idea . 
It is also of great importance to citizens . 
We should , above all , not lose sight of this . 
The impetus given to the European idea by this programme is having an enormous impact , especially on small linguistic areas such as the Netherlands which not only has national potential , but is also relying on support from the programme , mainly from a language point of view . 
Today , we have arrived at the end of a long road . 
I would nonetheless like , as others have done , to touch upon the procedure , which is unclear and , above all , unwanted . 
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand . 
They are like a snake biting its own tail . 
There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand : anything is open for discussion , as long as the budget stays fixed . 
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage . 
The result is 30 % growth , so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result . 
Of course , it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes . 
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot . 
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas . 
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds , and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind . 
Fortunately , I am on the Committee on Regional Policy . So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention . 
I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because , if it happens to be cancelled , then surely this does not benefit the citizen . 
I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect . 
However , I do think that it is necessary , as he always states too , that , in the next IGC , changes will be made to codecision , when unanimity will no longer be necessary . 
We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made : no more mega - projects , room for cultural networks , and sufficient attention to promoting reading , translating and translation companies . 
This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas . I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000 . 
All that remains for me to say is : time to get down to business . 
Madam President , all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture . 
I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart . 
Not because our delegation , our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding ' s attitude - I think that , given the framework she was operating in , her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council . 
It is shameful ! 
That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union ! 
When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups , young musicians , pioneering activities in the arts , writers , to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign , something opposed , contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro , not just enlargement , nor geostrategic expedients , but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end .
