Madam President , I would like to remind you that you said that the previous vote would be the last one , and I would also like to point out that this resolution , which is the result of an unfortunate accumulation of two oral questions , in violation of the Rules of Procedure and normal practice , is causing complicated problems in all of the Groups and I do not believe that this is the best way to deal with it . 
Ladies and gentlemen , we must think about this carefully . 
I did say clearly , at the start of voting time , that we would go as far as the motion for a resolution on the European Council in Lisbon . 
I said that we would end at 1 . 15 p . m . and we have respected this timetable . 
We should keep to what was decided . 
Madam President , I disagree with this decision . 
The House is free to decide if it wishes to vote on this now or not and I would therefore request that we take a vote on whether to vote . 
 ( The President put the proposal to the House which decided to end voting time ) 
Madam President , I did not want to interrupt the voting when I arrived a little bit late . 
Could we request that the bells be rung a little bit earlier ? 
People on the twelfth floor had extreme difficulty getting here for the vote as the lift stopped on every single floor and we could not make it any quicker . 
The lift was full of Vice - Presidents , Quaestors and all sorts of people coming down from the twelfth floor . 
Absolutely , Mrs Banotti . 
We will make a note of this .
